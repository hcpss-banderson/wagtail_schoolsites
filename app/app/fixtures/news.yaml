Using February 19 (President&rsquo;s Day) would have required a state waiver, as it is a state mandated holiday, and would have caused significant budget <span class=\"highlight\" id=\"0.5203162149177882\" name=\"searchHitInReadingPane\">press</span>ures. Instead, the Board of Education has approved the use May 18 in lieu of February 19 as a make-up day.</p>\n\n<p>After carefully reviewing our options, I want to provide you with the following information as well as my rationale about specific days to be used to make up school closings. I understand that any mid-year changes to the calendar can be disappointing, especially to students and families who have already made plans. Please be aware that our primary consideration in making these decisions is a commitment to quality instruction. We also wanted to provide you a level of predictability as we look ahead to the rest of the school year.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Schools now will be in session on April 4, 5, and 6 and for a half-day on May 18 to make up for the four inclement weather days used.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If schools are closed for one additional inclement weather day, June 15 will be used.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;State law mandates that the school year must be completed by June 15. If additional inclement weather closings become necessary, HCPSS will petition the Maryland State Department of Education for a waiver of the additional days.</p>\n\n<p>The fifth possible make-up day on June 15 falls on a Muslim holiday. Per Board policy, no activities or exams can be scheduled on this day. This will require all end of school assemblies, promotion ceremonies, celebrations and final exams to be held on June 14 but still require students to attend on the day after. As an educator and a parent, I know that adding an additional day to the end of the school year would not effectively replace the valuable instruction days lost to inclement weather. HCPSS will use June 15 as a last resort to ensure that makeup days will truly serve as replacement days for the instruction time that has been lost.</p>\n\n<p>We will continue to carefully weigh all decisions to close school when inclement weather threatens the safety of students and staff, and will notify families as soon as possible should any additional changes to the school calendar become necessary.

In 2015, about 3.8 million children received Summer Meals - far fewer than the 21 million children who receive free or reduced price lunches through the National School Lunch Program during the school year. This means that during the summer we are not reaching the vast majority of children who rely on school meals to meet their nutritional needs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates summer meals programs to address this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are pleased to inform you that our <a href=\"https://news.hcpss.org/news-posts/2019/05/summer-2019-food-service-program-expands-sites-to-help-children-and-families-in-need/\" target=\"_blank\">2019 Open Site Summer Meals Program</a> will begin on Tuesday, June 25, 2019 and run through Wednesday, August 21, 2019. The program hours will vary from location to location. All children 18 years of age and younger who drop in at any of the sites may receive free meals. Parents or guardians do not need to apply to get these summer meals for their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions or want to see a list of sites and their hours, please contact HCPSS Food and Nutrition Service at 410-313-7134 or at <a href=\"https://www.hcpss.org/food-services/\" target=\"_blank\">www.hcpss.org/food-services</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flyers with locations and more details about the program were sent home in Friday Folders mid-June.</p>\r\n", created: '2019-06-06 09:47:08.000000-04:00', updated: '2019-07-10 15:31:19.000000-04:00', first_published_at: '2019-06-06 09:47:08.000000-04:00', last_published_at: '2019-06-06 09:47:08.000000-04:00', latest_revision_created_at: '2019-07-10 15:31:19.000000-04:00' }

We have been busy preparing for the upcoming school year with our leadership team and various staff work groups. Many staff members participated in professional learning, taught summer school, attended meetings and planned during the summer months and we are grateful for their commitment to our students.&nbsp; Our custodial team (Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Osei, Mr. Cureton and Mrs. Smith) did an amazing job preparing the building for opening; the floors are glistening!&nbsp; Our incredible office staff was busy registering students and keeping things organized!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>In addition to the new students and families that will join us this school year, we will also welcome several new staff members.&nbsp; We look forward to greeting the smiling faces of new and returning students and working and learning with our new and returning staff members.&nbsp; Our theme for this school year is &ldquo;Constructing Great Minds and Building a Strong Foundation.&rdquo;&nbsp; The AES staff will work collaboratively to support and maintain a positive school culture and learning environment for all, where everyone is valued, connected, supported and appreciated.&nbsp; It is through our collective efforts that we will reach all students, academically, socially and emotionally while encouraging and modeling how to be kind citizens, problem solvers and creative thinkers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>As the summer comes to an end it begins a new and exciting chapter.&nbsp; In addition to the excitement, the new year brings new experiences and new opportunities to learn and grow.&nbsp; The road ahead is paved and ready to be traveled!&nbsp; Undoubtedly, the road will have its share of twists and turns but, it will be traveled in great company with our students, staff and community.&nbsp; We are excited to see the difference we are going to make this year!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Our phones, email inboxes, and doors are always open for feedback, questions, and suggestions.&nbsp; We look forward to serving each of you!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Best,</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Dr. Holden&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Mrs. Krablin</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Mrs. Webster</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\">&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\"><strong>News and Information</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\"><strong>Please Join Us in Welcoming New AES Staff</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Welcome to Susan Webster, Acting Assistant Principal</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Welcome Mrs. Susan Webster!&nbsp; We have the fine privilege of Mrs. Webster supporting us while Mrs. Krablin is on maternity leave.&nbsp; Prior to retiring from HCPSS, Mrs. Webster served many roles during her 35-year tenure.&nbsp; She even served as Assistant Principal right here at Atholton!&nbsp; She brings a wealth of knowledge and we are delighted to have her.&nbsp; Please find out more about Mrs. Webster on the AES website.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>A Warm Welcome to:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Lisa Carter, (.6) School Psychologist</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Catherine Clark, (.8) Occupational Therapist</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Kelly Clavell, (.5) Band Teacher</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Daniel Graham, (.6) Physical Education Teacher</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Shannon Majoros, PreK/Preschool Special Education Teacher</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Kelly Turner, Cafeteria Manager</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Eric Piccirelli, (.5) Strings Teacher</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Monica Zaleski, (.5) ESOL Teacher</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\"><strong>Upcoming Events</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Important Upcoming Dates</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>RECC/Preschool Open House:&nbsp;</strong> Tuesday, August 27th 5-6pm</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>New Student Orientation (Students new to grades 1-5):</strong> Friday, August 30th 1:15pm</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Open House:</strong> Friday, August 30<sup>th</sup> 2-3pm</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Back to School Picnic: </strong>Friday, September 13</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Kindergarten - Grade 2 Back to School Night:</strong>&nbsp; Monday, September 16<sup>th</sup> 6-7pm</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>GT Back to School Night:</strong> Wednesday, September 18<sup>th</sup> 5:30 &ndash; 6pm</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li><strong>Grades 3 - 5 Back to School Night:</strong> Wednesday, September 18<sup>th</sup> 6-7pm</li>\n\t\t\t\t</ul>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p align=\"center\"><strong>First Day of School Information and Reminders</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Every child&rsquo;s safety is important and we need your help.

Band (4th-5th Grade),&nbsp;Strings (3rd-5th Grade), and Chorus (4th-5th Grade) are all being offered virtually this year and your young musicians are invited to sign-up today. The Band, Strings, and Chorus classes this year will look very different from the Spring. Band and Strings classes will be held synchronously through Google Meet twice a week and Chorus will be once a month. Students will also be expected to practice outside of their synchronous meetings. The best part is that students will not miss synchronous instruction from their other classes! This is a fantastic opportunity for your young musicians to break up the flow of their school day by moving, learning something new, and making music with their friends and music teachers.</span></span></span></p>\n\n<p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"color: rgb(83, 83, 83); font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 14px; line-height: inherit; font-family: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: inherit;\"><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: inherit;\"><span style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">We enjoyed meeting all your young musicians this past week in their classes and look forward to meeting all of you next week at our Band, Strings, and Chorus Back to School Night.

A hybrid model could provide an option for parents/guardians to send their child to school part of the week and learn virtually for the remainder of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This fall, there will be significant public discussion and consideration around the second semester. At this time, HCPSS is seeking to understand families&rsquo; intentions regarding sending their students back to school, if that option becomes available, or continuing fully virtual learning. Please see directions below for accessing this questionnaire. Please note, this is separate from the small group instruction survey that some families have received. Additionally, it is crucial for planning to know if students who qualify to receive bus service would use it. Parent/guardian response is not a commitment for the second semester; you will be able to change your decision when plans for second semester are finalized. Your intention at this time will help facilitate planning.

This award has been 14 years in the making, so it was quite a treat to be informed of the good news on the evening of Earth Day. To become a certified Maryland Green School, a rigorous set of standards must be documented, to include environmental instruction throughout the school, student-driven best-management practices to promote sustainability, environmental staff professional learning, school-wide environmental celebrations/events, and partnership with the community to carry out our goals. We began this mission in 2007, receiving our first certification and Green School flag in 2009. The following three certifications would be awarded, through rigorous application, every four years, documenting four years of Green School activity per application.

As you peruse our electronic application, you will see years and years of dedication to incorporating Green School values at AES, serving as a model for our community. Did you know we have a beautiful native garden? Have you been to our outdoor classroom? Did you know we raise and release Trout and Monarch butterflies every year? Have you seen the amazing recycled sculptures our students create each year for America Recycles Day? Has your family participated in Bike to School Day? Has your child been involved in a scout troop that volunteers to support our Green School? Did you know we have student recyclers at AES? We have countless examples of the work we continue to do to support our amazing Green School. Thank you for your support over the years. Our work is not yet done. We will forge on to ensure Atholton continues to operate with the environment in mind. And though our next application, four years from now, will look a little different from what we have submitted previously, we will still be held accountable by the Maryland Association of Environmental Outdoor Education for the Green School efforts we make.</span><span style=\"color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</span><span class=\"x_mark06lcm4x0w x_LMEtDboTwopWdh5S5P1E\" style=\"color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 1px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline; border-radius: 2px;\">Congratulations</span><span style=\"color: inherit; font: inherit; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">on Sustainability, Atholton!</span></p>\n\n<div class=\"x_x_elementToProof\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 12pt; line-height: inherit; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0) !important;\">&nbsp;</div>\n\n<div class=\"x_x_elementToProof\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 12pt; line-height: inherit; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0) !important;\"><u>Earth Day Scavenger Hunt Drawing Winners</u></div>\n\n<div style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: Calibri, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\">\n\t<div class=\"x_x_elementToProof\" style=\"margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 12pt; line-height: inherit; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline;\">Atholton received 261 student scavenger hunts after this year&#39;s Earth Day Week.
