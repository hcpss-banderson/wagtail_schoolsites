      to 9:00.  Here are the procedures for inclement weather day arrival: \r\n\r\nThis
      year we will continue to offer an arrival procedure for student drop off on
      inclement weather days, i.e. rain, snow, and icy sidewalks.  This procedure
      will be called Drop and Go.  In order to implement this plan we need parent
      support with following these guidelines: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tStudents with bus transportation
      should ride the bus. \r\n\tThe bus loop will be open from 8:50 a.m. – 9:00 a.m.
      and will reopen after the buses leave at 9:10 a.m. \r\n\tParents should pull
      all the way around the bus loop to allow cars to file in behind. \r\n\tStudents
      should quickly exit the car with their belongings. \r\n\tOnce the student is
      safely on the sidewalk the car can exit the bus loop. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot
      have any cars park in the bus loop during the Drop & Go.  Once it is 9:00 a.m.
      we are no longer going to allow cars to enter the loop.  At this time we need
      the bus loop cleared for our buses to arrive safely.  We will have several staff
      members outside to assist with directing traffic and opening car doors for students
      to exit quickly and safely. "

    title: No More Juice Bag Upcycling
    body: As we continue to promote a waste-free Green School at AES, the Green Team
      and the fifth grade Green Ambassadors would like to inform our families we are
      no longer able to send student juice bags from lunches to Terracycle to be turned
      into other products.  This means, beginning January 1st, all empty juice bags
      will be thrown in the trash.  We ask our AES families to consider a reusable
      or recyclable alternative.  Recyclables include cartons, plastic, and aluminum. 
      However, a reusable drink container will create zero waste at our school.  Thank
      you for your support in keeping our school and students green and aware of other
      Earth-friendly options.

    body: "As we get into the spring season there are a variety of citizen science
      programs you and your students can participate in to identify local amphibians
      that are coming out of hiding.  Citizen science reporting can lead to interesting
      discussions about why some students hear more than others depending on the habitats
      near where they live.   \r\n\r\nField Guide to MD Frogs & Toads is a field guide
      to all 20 species in Maryland with a dichotomus key that can be used for positive
      identification of most species. This site has more detailed information on each
      species and distribution maps for where each species can be found in Maryland. 
      \r\n\r\nMaryland Amphibian and Reptile Database is also run by DNR and they
      also have an extensive local database in the that was generated by local naturalists
      and state scientists that anyone can access for free. \r\n\r\nFrogwatch is very
      active in Maryland.  This program is run by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums,
      and if you join and register you can contribute to their database.  Without
      registering you can use this link to see pictures and hear sounds of all our
      local frogs and toads. "

    body: "June 23, 2016 \r\n\r\nDear Parents, \r\n\r\nI am writing to share some
      important news.  Tonight, the Howard County Board of Education was informed
      of my transfer to Deep Run Elementary, effective July 1, 2016. I am humbled
      and excited to be given the opportunity to go to Deep Run, but equally sad to
      leave the students and families, as well as my colleagues, at Atholton. \r\n\r\nIt
      has been my honor and privilege to serve the Atholton Elementary community as
      principal. I want to thank the students and parents for all the support I received
      over the past three and a half years as we collaboratively worked to boost the
      achievement of all our students.  I tell people all the time that I have the
      best job in the world!   I have been able to go to work and spend my day with
      425 beautiful children and 75 very talented adults.  I have also come to know
      the families and have enjoyed working with an amazing PTA.  Thank you for all
      your support. \r\n\r\nI am pleased to share that Ms. Shawna Holden will be the
      new principal of Atholton. She is an experienced principal from Prince George’s
      County.  I will be meeting with Ms. Holden and our assistant principal, Miss
      Secula, to ensure a smooth transition for the opening of the new school year.
      \ \r\n\r\nThere will be opportunities for parents and students to meet Ms. Holden
      this summer. She will be sending additional communications soon introducing
      herself and sharing details about meeting with the school community.  \r\n\r\nOnce
      again, I want to thank each of you for allowing me to work with your children
      and for supporting me during my time as the proud principal of Atholton Elementary
      School; it is truly a special place. I wish each of you continued success and
      happiness. \r\n\r\nWith sincere appreciation and thanks, \r\n\r\nDenise Lancaster"

    body: "Greetings, \r\n\r\nIt is with great pride and excitement that I introduce
      myself as the new Principal of Atholton Elementary.  I am honored to have the
      opportunity to be a member of such a great learning community.  \r\n\r\nDuring
      the past few weeks, I have had interactions with school staff and county leaders. 
      From these conversations, it is clear there is a collegial partnership between
      all stakeholders to provide the best academic experience for our students. 
      I look forward to fostering these relationships and working with the staff and
      community to provide a world-class educational opportunity for each child. \r\n\r\nI
      have been dedicated to the field of education for more than 15 years and began
      my teaching career here in Howard County at Talbott Springs Elementary School. 
      My most recent administrative experience has been shaped by four years of successful
      leadership as an Elementary Principal (grades PreK-6), four years as an Instructional
      Specialist (K-12), and three years as an Assistant Principal.  I am elated to
      bring my skills as an instructional leader to Atholton, and to work collaboratively
      with staff, students and parents to ensure the success of all students. \r\n\r\nAlong
      with staff, I will work to continue and build upon the legacy of success that
      has been established at Atholton Elementary by building strong relationships
      with staff, parents, students, and the community.  Our main goal is to ensure
      that every student is provided the highest quality education in a safe and supportive
      environment.  We will use data to inform instruction and provide exciting and
      rigorous enrichment opportunities for all students.  \r\n\r\nMy door is always
      open and I welcome your input.  I invite you to call, visit, schedule an appointment,
      or send me an email (Shawna_holden@hcpss.org) to discuss any concerns, suggestions,
      or ideas.  I am eager to begin what promises to be a great year.  To facilitate
      our ongoing communication and collaboration, I invite you to attend a Meet and
      Greet session, dates will be announced in the near future.  I look forward to
      meeting and talking with you and your family. \r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\n\r\nShawna
      Holden, Ed.D. \r\n\r\nPrincipal \r\n\r\n "

      in between the cones. Please remember that due to space, only volunteers asked
      to assist with the party will be able to come into the building after the parade.

      in the parade or party. Please send a note to your child’s teacher if your child

      \r\n\r\nStudents with symptoms of acute illness such as vomiting, diarrhea,

      a doctor if necessary.   \r\n\r\nIf your child is diagnosed with any disease
      that could be contagious (such as strep throat, conjunctivitis, mumps, chicken

      cases. The health room tracks communicable diseases such as strep throat, conjunctivitis
      (pink eye), influenza, mono and fifth disease, in order to do so properly, the
      health room needs a note from a doctor/medical provider with a clear written
      diagnosis. \r\n\r\nRemember, frequent hand washing is known to reduce the spread

      self-worth instead of societal worth; and cooperation instead of rivalry. Our
      mission is to inspire girls to be joyful, healthy and confident using a fun,
      experience-based curriculum which creatively integrates running. The girls will
      meet after-school twice a week for 10 weeks with the season ending 5k to be
      held on June 3rd in Howard County, MD. Atholton ES will meet on Mondays and
      Thursdays from 3:45-5:00pm starting the week of March 19th. Registration opens
      on Sunday, February 12th at 12:00 noon. Visit www.gotrcentralmd.org to register.

    title: Jump Rope for Heart Zoo Crew Challenge!
    body: "THANK YOU for all your support for our Jump Rope for Heart event! This
      year we have a brand new challenge for our students called the Zoo Crew E-card
      Challenge! This is when your student will go online, challenge themselves to
      do a heart healthy activity every day, and then send it out to 10 people so
      they can be healthy too! They will even get to pick their own animal and background!!
      \n\tWhy is this SO important?! The American Heart Association wants each child
      to start healthy habits as early as possible. This is an easy and fun way to
      do it that not only involves them but also their friends and family! We also
      found out that if 30% of the school does this challenge, we would get up to
      $500 in US games certificates AND for every class who has every student complete
      this challenge, they will get a basket of RECESS EQUIPMENT (possible items:
      jump ropes, basketballs, kickballs, or soccer balls). \n\nHow can you do this
      with your student? Register online at heart.org/jump, login into your account,
      and complete the mission in step 1 AND step 2. \n\nTHANK YOU for everything
      you are doing for the American Heart Association and for our Physical Education
      Department!"

      off in the Atholton Park- there are staff members at the park during arrival
      time (9:00 – 9:15). \n\tPark your car on a side street (Groveleigh Drive) and

    body: "Last year was so successful that this year's dual-theme for Earth Day Week
      is once again \"Earth-Friendly Transportation\" and \"No Child Left Inside -
      Get Outside to Learn.\"  \n\nStarting April 15th and running all week through
      April 23rd, AES families are encouraged to take 'selfies' of any Earth-friendly
      transportation they engage in to get somewhere, which could include walking,
      bike-riding, carpooling, or taking a bus. Selfies should include everyone involved
      and should be sent to Mrs. Simon in the front office (michelle_simon@hcpss.org).
      She will print them out and put them on a bulletin board in our main hallway.
      Our goal is to fill up the board with pictures of our students and staff using
      Earth-Friendly ways to get around in our community. When you email your selfie
      to Mrs. Simon, be sure to explain the photo.  \n\nThank you for participating
      in Atholton's Earth Day fun. As always, we will continue our Waste-free lunches,
      recycling, and our regular environmental instruction. Each class will take some
      time outside of its four walls to get some fresh air during instruction. Have
      a wonderful Earth Day Week; we hope you can get outside to enjoy NATURE, too!"

      procedures below for drop off and pick up. \r\n\t  \r\n\tAM Drop Off: \r\n\tWhen
      driving your child to school in the morning please drop off at the Atholton
      Park on Donleigh.  Our staff will be available from 9:00- 9:15.   After 9:15
      students should be escorted into the building and signed in at the office. 
      After all buses have dropped off students, cars are permitted to enter the bus
      loop. This will not be until 9:15 am.  In order to ensure the safety of your
      child please do not drop off on Seneca Drive.  You may park your car at Groveleigh
      Drive and escort your child across the street using the crosswalk. \r\n\t  \r\n\tPM
      Pick-Up: \r\n\tStudents will exit out the back of the building at 3:40 pm. 
      You can meet your student on the blacktop.  Please note that the Atholton Park
      parking lot does get very crowded.  For the safety of your child and others,
      please park in the lined parking spaces.  Please do not park along the entrance
      to the park.  Parallel parking impedes the flow of traffic in and out of the
      park.  You may park on Donleigh or Wesleigh and walk to the park or back of
      the school to meet your child. \r\n\t  \r\n\tWe urge parents to be patient when
      dropping off and picking up to ensure safety of all. \r\n\t  \r\n\tThank you
      for your cooperation in this matter as we work towards a better practice for
      arrival and dismissal."

    body: "Every child’s safety is important to us and we need your help. It remains
      our highest priority to ensure that students are dropped off and picked up daily
      in a safe and organized manner.  We are reminding everyone to follow the pick-up
      and drop-off procedures.  Failure to do so creates chaos, and unsafe conditions
      for our students, parents, and staff. \n\n \n\tArrival: \n\tFor the safety of
      our students, please do not drop your children off in front of the school prior
      to 9am.  We do not have staff on duty before 9am; therefore, students dropped
      off before this time are unsupervised.  We want to ensure the safety of our
      children and appreciate your cooperation. \n\n \n\tCar riders can be dropped
      off at the Atholton Park located on Wesleigh at 9am.  We will have staff along
      the sidewalk to monitor student arrival. \n\n \n\tDuring morning arrival, the
      bus loop is reserved for buses and Pre-K students only, between 9 and 9:15. 
      Cars cannot enter the bus loop during this time.  Once all the buses have arrived,
      cars will be permitted to enter the bus loop. \n\n \n\tMorning Drop Off Options
      \n\t•    We are asking that during the 9:00-9:15 bus arrival, cars do not enter
      the bus loop with the exception of our Pre-K students.  If you are a Pre-K parent
      dropping off, please make sure the RECC tag is displayed on your dashboard.
      \n\t•    Park your car on a side street (Groveleigh Drive) and walk your child
      across the street utilizing the crosswalk. \n\t•    Park your car on Donleigh
      and walk along Seneca. \n\t•    Please do not stop your vehicle along Seneca
      Drive during morning drop off or dismissal. This is extremely dangerous, and
      impedes the flow of traffic for buses and the community. \n\n \n\tDismissal:
      \n\tThe car riders, walkers, and CA students are dismissed at 3:40 daily.  Bus
      riders are dismissed at 3:45. Parents picking up students should park at the

      then gather pledges for every lap your student runs (30-35 laps), and we’ll

      for additional computers for our students to use, we asked the Fun Run experts
      at Boosterthon to power our Fun Run and make it more profitable, easier, and
      fun. \n\nStudents will also experience an amazing character theme, CASTLE QUEST!
      an English castle theme all about being brave and living with character. On
      their quest to regain Bravemore Castle, students will learn the “SIX VIRTUES
      of a TRUE HERO” from a cast of colorful characters. \n\nDonations will go toward
      those additional computers and to the entire 9-day experience. So please help
      our school by reaching out to sponsors. Also, all families are invited to come
      out and cheer on your student at the Fun Run! Thank you for your support! To

    title: Inclement Weather Make- Up Days Announced
    body: "Dear HCPSS Community: \n\tNow that we have had a fourth inclement weather-related
      closing, I want to give you an update on the school calendar for the remainder
      of this year. \n\nOur academic calendar designates five possible inclement weather
      make-up days: February 19, April 4, 5, and 6, and June 15. Using February 19
      (President’s Day) would have required a state waiver, as it is a state mandated
      holiday, and would have caused significant budget pressures. Instead, the Board
      of Education has approved the use May 18 in lieu of February 19 as a make-up
      day. \n\nAfter carefully reviewing our options, I want to provide you with the
      following information as well as my rationale about specific days to be used
      to make up school closings. I understand that any mid-year changes to the calendar
      can be disappointing, especially to students and families who have already made
      plans. Please be aware that our primary consideration in making these decisions
      is a commitment to quality instruction. We also wanted to provide you a level
      of predictability as we look ahead to the rest of the school year. \n\n    
      •    Schools now will be in session on April 4, 5, and 6 and for a half-day
      on May 18 to make up for the four inclement weather days used. \n\t     •  
       If schools are closed for one additional inclement weather day, June 15 will
      be used. \n\t     •    State law mandates that the school year must be completed
      by June 15. If additional inclement weather closings become necessary, HCPSS
      will petition the Maryland State Department of Education for a waiver of the
      additional days. \n\nThe fifth possible make-up day on June 15 falls on a Muslim
      holiday. Per Board policy, no activities or exams can be scheduled on this day.
      This will require all end of school assemblies, promotion ceremonies, celebrations
      and final exams to be held on June 14 but still require students to attend on
      the day after. As an educator and a parent, I know that adding an additional
      day to the end of the school year would not effectively replace the valuable
      instruction days lost to inclement weather. HCPSS will use June 15 as a last
      resort to ensure that makeup days will truly serve as replacement days for the
      instruction time that has been lost. \n\nWe will continue to carefully weigh
      all decisions to close school when inclement weather threatens the safety of
      students and staff, and will notify families as soon as possible should any
      additional changes to the school calendar become necessary. For more information
      on the school calendar and inclement weather closings, please visit www.hcpss.org.
      \n\nSincerely, \n\nMichael J. Martirano \n\nInterim Superintendent"

    body: "TEN YEARS OF BEING GREEN (And Eleven at the End of This School Year!) \r\n\tThis
      year’s AES Earth Day Week theme is Ten Years of Being Green, so our fourth grade
      Green Ambassadors came up with a school-wide plan for a home-to-school connection:
      Each class will develop a Top Ten list of what students do at home to be green
      citizens.  Since this activity will prompt some discussion during class, we
      wanted to give our families an opportunity to have a discussion about this topic
      at home first. What do you do as a family at home to promote Earth-Friendly
      practices? Have your child share your family's contribution to leaving a smaller
      footprint. We can't wait to hear how AES families are making a difference! \r\n\r\nEARTH
      DAY WEEK GREEN BINGO & DRAWING! \r\n\tOur fourth grade Green Ambassadors have
      come up with a Green Bingo board to use at home to promote being environmentally
      friendly. If your child completes the Green Bingo board and returns it signed
      by an adult, s/he will be entered in a drawing to win one of two prizes - the
      adorable picture book, titled I am Earth by Rebecca and James McDonald, or a
      very cute plush Earth. The deadline to return the completed and signed Bingo
      board will be Friday, April 27th, and the winner will be announced Monday, April
      30th. \r\n\r\n\"SHOW 'N GREEN\" \r\n\tGreen Ambassadors also came up with this
      great idea.  Instead of “Show 'n Tell,” students can bring in something to share
      with the class that has something to do with being green. This is a great opportunity
      for your child to get up and share a bit about your green ways at home - and
      hopefully motivate others to do the same! \r\n\r\nENDANGERED SPECIES - TECHNOLOGY
      \r\n\tTwo of our fourth grade Green Ambassadors, Cassia B. and Olivia T., have
      been collaborating with Mrs. Muir to create Technology class lesson plans for
      all grades to engage in during Earth Day Week. Ask your child which animal s/he
      chose to learn about. \r\n\r\nSTRAW AWARENESS \r\n\tA small group of fifth graders
      took it upon themselves to put together a presentation for each grade to watch
      during their lunch shifts. This presentation is about the negative impacts straws
      can have on our environment. These past fourth grade Green Ambassadors are passionate
      about the environment and hope to ignite a reduction in straw usage at AES.
      \r\n\r\nMORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS \r\n\tEach day during Earth Day Week, fourth grade
      Green Ambassadors will share a few facts during morning announcements to start
      each day off with a reminder we must keep the Earth in mind as we live our daily
      lives. \r\n\r\nTHE GREEN INFORMER - Issue 2 \r\n\tIt's official!  The second
      issue of Atholton's Green Informer is OUT!  Hot off the press and found in a
      Friday folder near you... or here in electronic format.  Please enjoy a little
      bit of Earth Day history, try your hand at a green crossword puzzle, and read
      about the morning our 4th grade Green Ambassadors showed up early to school
      to collaborate with the staff members on Atholton's Green Team. Oh, and find
      out what we do with all those empty glue sticks and dried up markers while you're
      at it.  Enjoy! \r\n\r\nINDIVIDUAL CLASS ACTIVITIES \r\n\tIn addition to these
      school-wide Earth Day Week activities, your child will engage in instructional
      activities in their own classrooms to celebrate Earth Day Week. Don't forget
      to ask your child what they have been doing at school to recognize the importance
      of taking care of our planet. \r\n\r\nHAPPY EARTH DAY WEEK FROM OUR TEN-YEAR-STRONG

    body: "Bike to School Day is Wednesday, May 9th and all AES students, parents
      and staff are invited to strap on your helmets, raise your kickstands, and join
      in the fun.  Last year we had about 60 students and parents ride their bike
      to school.  Let’s beat that number this year.  How many bikes can we get to
      school at the same time? \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in biking to school,
      but uncertain about how to do it safely we can help: \r\n\r\nAES 2018 BIKE TO
      SCHOOL DAY GROUP RIDE SAFETY INFORMATION: \r\n\r\nYou MUST wear a good fitting
      helmet to ride. To check: while your helmet is on and buckled, shake and nod
      your head. It should cover your forehead and only minimally move. Brightly colored
      clothes are also recommended. \r\n\r\nPlease check tire pressure and brakes
      before coming. \r\n\r\nStudents should stay between the lead and end adults
      at all times.We will have at least two adult escort bikes with each riding group.
      Parents of students are encouraged to join the ride and help us increase the
      adult to student ratio. We are hopeful that Howard County’s Police Bike Patrol
      will join us. \r\n\r\nRoutes were chosen to be as safe as possible, minimize
      elevation while serving our school walker zone. We will be riding on the paths,
      bike lanes, and right-hand side of the roads. We will not be riding on sidewalks
      except where necessary to join to paths. If you have not ridden to school before,
      build your confidence with a practice run over the weekend! \r\n\r\nWe will
      do a return ride in the afternoon leaving about 10min after school dismissal,
      returning to our morning starting point. Let us know in the morning if you will
      be returning with us in the afternoon. Return riders will meet at the paint
      circle near the school. \r\n\r\nFrom North of AES:   Meet at Carlinda x Evergreen
      at 8:20 sharp. \r\n\thttps://goo.gl/maps/zYUhRzR5FwG2    \r\n\r\nFrom South
      of AES:  Meet at Cape Anne x S. Carlinda at 8:30 sharp. \r\n\thttps://goo.gl/maps/u1Vsoa2skbE2 
      \r\n\r\nConcerns or questions? Contact April Cropper at aprilRcropper@gmail.com
      or 443-745-0739. \r\n\r\nGet ready to pedal your way to school!  We will take
      a group photo at 9am."

      would like to thank you for your ongoing support throughout the year.  We could
      not offer such a rich education to our students without the continuing effort
      and support that you all give. And to our volunteers and PTA, we deeply appreciate
      the countless hours you dedicate to our school.  You are involved in so many
      behind the scenes activities such as fundraising, reading with our students,
      assisting in the classroom, chaperoning field trips and the list goes on and
      on. \r\n\r\nMost importantly our students have enjoyed another fabulous year.
      They have excelled in so many ways.  Their achievements have been in their academic
      studies, sports, music, and the arts to name just a few and we are extremely
      proud of them. \r\n\r\nWith the end of the year also comes staff changes and
      family moves.  We would like to take this opportunity to wish those students
      and families leaving us this year all the best in their new schools and homes.
      \r\n\tOver the summer we will work with colleagues and staff to plan a smooth
      opening to the new academic year and set priorities to build upon the successes
      of the school so that we can continue to improve. \r\n\r\nPersonnel Departures

      will continue to support students and families throughout HCPSS as an Early
      Intervention Services Resource Teacher. We wish her the best of luck in her
      new position. \r\n\tMs. Murawski (Vocal Music) will be moving on to other endeavors
      outside HCPSS. \r\n\tMr. Parlette (Technology) will continue his role at Hammond
      and Thunderhill Elementary Schools. \r\n\tMs. Kaminski (RECC Teacher) will be

      Assistant) will continue her role at another HCPSS school. \r\n\tMrs. Wiley
      (Temporary Employee) and her family are relocating. \r\n\tMrs. Minnick  (Part-time
      Secretary) will continue her role full time at Patuxent Valley Middle School.

      staff members who will be leaving us.  They will be missed!   \r\n\r\nStaff
      Changes \r\n\r\n\r\n\tAdditional staff changes will be shared as they are confirmed

      are actively working on class assignments.  As you know, we work collaboratively
      with grade level teams and central office support staff to create classes. \r\n\tHomeroom
      teacher assignments will be available in HCPSS Connect at a date to be determined
      by the county after parents/guardians have updated and submitted the Family

      to update their Family File in late summer.  We are unable to disseminate any
      information on class assignments before that time. Thank you for your understanding
      and patience. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe would like to wish everyone an enjoyable summer
      vacation and look forward to welcoming you back for what will be an exciting,
      new year! \r\n\r\nBest, \r\n\r\nDr. Holden and Mrs. Krablin"

      Arts and Math PARCC (Partnership for Assessment of Readiness of College and
      Careers) test scores from this past spring in Family File. Paper copies will
      go home in September. \r\n\r\n \r\n\tIn ELA, the number of students who scored
      a 4 (met expectations) or 5 (exceeded expectations) decreased compared to 2017,
      but was higher than in 2016. In math, the number of students who scored 4 (met
      expectations) or 5 (exceeded expectations) increased by 5% compared to 2017. 
      We had a significant number of students who were very close to meeting expectations.
      \r\n\r\n \r\n\tWe are extremely proud of our students for their hard work. The
      data and information from this year's administration of PARCC will help teachers
      and administrators plan for the upcoming school year. \r\n\r\n \r\n\tProof of
      Residency \r\n\r\nIf your family received a letter asking for proofs of residency
      because your child's registration is a multiple family registration, please
      bring those two proofs of your address to us as soon as possible!  This information
      was included with your child’s last report card that was mailed. \r\n\r\n \r\n\tSupply

      to seeing everyone at the start of our new school year. \r\n\r\nDr. Holden &

    title: First Day of School Information and Reminders
    body: "We are looking forward to seeing your children Tuesday morning.  \n\nEvery
      child’s safety is important to us and we need your help. It remains our highest
      priority to ensure that students are dropped off and picked up daily in a safe
      and organized manner.  We are reminding everyone to follow the pick-up, drop-off
      procedures.  Failure to do so creates chaos, and unsafe conditions for our students,
      parents, and staff.  Please be kind to our staff and community members that
      may be directing traffic and guiding students. \n\n  \n\nSchoolwide Arrival
      \n\nPlease have your child come to school the way he/she will come to school
      every day.  We will have staff boarding buses and placing bus number tags on
      backpacks.  All bus riders will be escorted into the building. Our walkers and
      car riders will enter through the rear entrance doors.  Doors will open at 9:00
      a.m.  Any student arriving after 9:15 a.m. must be accompanied by an adult to
      the front office. \n\nKindergarten students should wear the nametags they received
      during Kindergarten Orientation.  Do not worry, kindergarteners of families
      who were unable to attend the Kindergarten Orientation or Open House will receive
      a nametag.  Staff will guide the kindergarteners off the bus.  Kindergarten
      staff will also meet walkers and car riders at the back of the school.  Students
      in grades 1-5 will be directed to their classrooms.  Staff will be available
      throughout the building to assist all students.  We ask parents/guardians to
      say goodbye at home and at the front or rear door of the school.  Thank you
      for understanding. \n\nDuring arrival, between 8:50 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. orange
      cones will be placed along the crosswalk at the back of the school. During this
      time cars cannot enter or exit the rear parking lot.  Persons that enter the
      parking lot prior to 8:50 a.m. will be asked to remain in the parking lot until
      9:15 a.m. \n\nPlease do not leave your child without supervision. There is no
      supervision for students until 9:00 a.m. \n\n  \n\nAM Drop Off \n\nParents/guardians
      driving children to school should use the Atholton Park or park along Donleigh
      Drive.  Please do not park along the entrance or exit to the Atholton Park. 
      NO PARKING signs will be posted along the park entrance as a reminder.  Please
      be courteous of our neighbors and only park on one side of the street in the
      neighborhood. \n\nParents may also park on Groveleigh Drive and use the crosswalk
      to escort children across the street.  Please do not drop off children along
      Seneca Drive.  This is dangerous.  STOP NO STUDENT DROP OFF OR PICK UP signs
      will be posted as a reminder. \n\nAfter all buses have dropped off students,
      cars will be permitted to enter the bus loop, after 9:15 a.m. \n\n  \n\nDismissal
      \n\nAll car riders, walkers, and students that participate in after school programs
      or attend after care centers will be dismissed at 3:37 p.m.  All bus riders
      will be dismissed at 3:45 p.m. \n\nPlease inform your child’s teacher in writing
      if dismissal is different than arrival.  During dismissal, our staff will ensure
      students get on the correct bus based on the bus they rode to school in the
      morning, or other information obtained in writing from the parent/guardian. 
      All walkers will be escorted to the back of the school to meet their parent/guardian,
      or be escorted to the parent/guardian selected after care provider or program. 
      All walker/car rider kindergarten students will be dismissed from the rear kindergarten
      doors and be released to the parent/guardian, or designated adult for pick up.
      \n\nParents/guardians of walkers and car riders should park in the Atholton
      Park and walk to the back of the school to meet their children.  If the Atholton
      Park lot is full, please do not park along the entrance to the park.  Please
      park along Donleigh. \n\nTo ensure a safe dismissal, cars are not able to park
      in the school lot during dismissal. \n\n  \n\nBus Information \n\nIf your child
      rides a bus, please arrive at the bus stop 5-10 minutes before your bus is due
      to arrive in the morning.  Please allow some flexibility in AM and PM arrival
      times the first week or two of school. \n\nIt is very important to put your
      child on the bus on the first day. Students who ride buses will have their bus
      number tagged on their backpack with a wristband strip. Please leave the bus
      tag on their backpack. This will help staff escort students to the correct bus
      in the afternoon and throughout the school year. \n\n  \n\nPositive Behavioral
      Interventions and Supports (PBIS) \n\nWe will continue to use PBIS and the 3Rs
      – Respectful, Ready and Responsible to highlight positive behavior.  Teachers
      will spend time the first few weeks of school getting to know each learner and
      building community to create a positive learning environment that ensures equity
      in the classroom. This year we will enhance PBIS with 123 Magic. This program
      will support all staff with establishing and maintaining good discipline habits
      and encouraging courteous classroom behavior and constructive work habits. 
      We look forward to scheduling a parent/guardian information night to share more
      information about how the program will be implemented at AES as well as ways
      the program can be implemented at home. \n\n \n\tFood Services \n\nOur Food
      and Nutrition Services web page has information parents/guardians may find helpful,
      including meal prices, how to pay for meals, where to view menus, nutritional
      and allergen information, and more. \n\nStudent Breakfast - $2.00                                       
      Student Lunch - $2.75 \n\nReduced Breakfast - $.30                                       
      Reduced Lunch - $.40 \n\n                                                Milk
      - $.50 \n\nParents/guardians of students who qualify for Free and Reduced Meals
      (FARMS) must submit a new application every school year. Students that qualified
      for free or reduced meals last school year will receive free or reduced lunch
      prices during the first 30 days of school. Details on the HCPSS FARMs program
      is online including how to apply. Please call the school if you have questions
      or need assistance. \n\nAt Atholton, we serve breakfast each morning from 9:00
      a.m. to 9:15 a.m.  Students who wish to purchase breakfast simply need to go
      to the cafeteria when they arrive in the morning. \n\nLunches are scheduled
      between 10:50 a.m. and 2:05 p.m. \n\n \n\tSnack \n\nOnly kindergarten and grades
      5 students will have a classroom snack this year due to the time of our scheduled
      lunches.  Kindergarten and grade 5 families will receive a list of acceptable
      snacks. \n\n  \n\nUpdate Emergency Information \n\nIf you have not updated/completed
      your Family File, please take care of this as soon as possible at HCPSS Connect. 
      There are several resources to assist you in completing the emergency contact
      information. \n\n  \n\nPets \n\nWe love our pets here at Atholton, however for
      the safety of our students we ask that you not bring your pets to school with
      you to drop off or pick up students. Effective August 29, 2017 animals in schools
      or offices, leashed or not, present safety, environmental, and liability issues. 
      Students and staff may be exposed to potential physical hazards, such as bites,
      and/or allergy related health problems.  As a result, animals are prohibited
      within HCPSS buildings.  Animals are also prohibited on school system property
      during arrival, dismissal, recess or other HCPSS sponsored outdoor activities. 
      Service animals or service animals in training per MD Annotated Code Section
      7-705 (Service Animals) and the American Disabilities Act (ADA) as well as animals
      approved for instructional purposes are exempt from this prohibition. \n\n 
      \n\nThank you for your continued support.  Please do not hesitate to contact
      us with any questions or concerns.  We are looking forward to a positive and
      enriching school year with our students! \n\n  \n\nDr. Holden, Principal \n\nMrs.

    body: "Dismissal for After School Programs AND any changes to a student's regular
      dismissal \r\n\r\nPlease make sure to send a note in with your student if they
      will be dismissed in a different manner than usual. (I.E. usually rides the
      bus, but today will be a walker). This procedure also includes after school
      programs held at AES that student's have signed up for.(I.E. Please dismiss
      \"Susie\" to the soccer after school program today.\") Classroom teachers require
      a note each time/day to ensure that your student is dismissed properly.  Notes
      are not accepted with multiple dates.  This keeps everyone (teacher/substitute)
      informed.  For example, if the classroom teacher is out sick or has to leave
      suddenly, the person covering in the classroom would have no idea that a note
      had been sent in days earlier. \r\n\r\nStudents that attend the Columbia Association
      (CA) Aftercare program are ALWAYS dismissed to CA and the after school program
      leader will sign out the student from CA and sign them back into CA after the
      after school event is over.  For this reason, CA Aftercare participants DO NOT
      need a dismissal note for their classroom teacher.  Please note: the Columbia
      Association may have requirements regarding release of students from their program.
      Please adhere to any procedures that CA has in place for this process. \r\n\r\nIf
      you forget to send a note in with your student, please call the front office
      to convey the change in dismissal.  Emails to teachers are not recognized as
      a form of dismissal communication, again because the teacher may be absent,
      or may be with students all day and not see the message. \r\n\r\nWe thank you
      in advance for your help in making sure that all 400+ of our students arrive
      to their destinations safely! If you have any questions or concerns, please
      call the school."

      Students will walk, jog, or run as many laps as they can around the course during

      for their team by moving the entire time. \r\n\r\nGrades K-2 will have 15 minutes
      and Grades 3-5 will have 20 minutes to earn as many laps as they can towards
      their team total! \r\n\r\nStudents will earn a popsicle stick for each lap they
      complete. Volunteers will place the popsicle sticks in the assigned team bin.
      Each grade level will have a class on the blue, white, and yellow team. At the
      end of the day, we will announce how many laps each team was able to complete.
      \r\n\r\nYour help is needed in order to make the Turkey Trot a success. We need
      volunteers to pass out popsicle sticks, ensure students are running the correct
      way and staying on the course. We would like to have 6 volunteers per grade.
      If a grade level has the number of volunteers requested, you can support the
      students during the Turkey Trot by cheering them on and watching. \r\n\r\nThank
      you for your support! \r\n\tMr. Trawick and Ms. Smalls, \r\n\tAES PE Teachers

      school on Monday, November 12th; they will be displayed in the front hallway
      of the school. Sculptures will remain on display through Friday, Nov. 16th for
      American Education Week. All participants will receive a recognition award certificate
      of participation. If your child is interested in participating in this opportunity,
      please complete the form that was sent home in the 10/26 Friday folder and return
      it to school by Friday, Nov. 9th. Siblings can submit their names on one form.

    body: "Dear Families, \r\n\r\nThe ongoing shutdown of the federal government has
      caused financial hardship for too many of our friends and neighbors. Additionally,
      we know that students are experiencing anxiety and fear for their family's financial
      situation. I wanted to let you know of a few supports that are in place to help
      at this time. \r\n\r\nHoward County families who have lost pay due to the shutdown
      may  immediately apply for the Free and Reduced-Priced Meals (FARMs) program
      and the HCPSS Food and Nutrition Office will determine their eligibility status
      within 24-48 hours. Families that would not ordinarily qualify for the FARMs
      program could be eligible for the remainder of the school year because of the
      current loss of income. \r\n\r\nFamilies that are adversely impacted, including
      those who do not receive FARMs assistance, will have the remainder of the school
      year to pay off any meal balances incurred during the government shutdown. \r\n\r\nAdditionally,
      many students may be suffering fear or anxiety about their family’s current
      financial situation. Student Services staff at each school are prepared and
      available to assist students at any time during the school day. Additionally,
      numerous resources for families are identified on the  HCPSS website, and other
      supports are available through the Howard County  Department of Community Resources
      and Services. \r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to me if you have
      any concerns or should your child/family need additional supports or resources. 
      We are able to provide field trip funding and other funding for impacted students. 
      We are here to support you!"

      it will be Wear Blue, Save Water, too Day.  Students will learn about water
      conservation, and we’ll wear a sea of blue to promote clean & plentiful water.
      \r\n\r\nWednesday will be Wastefree Wednesday.  We will focus on the 3 R’s –
      Reducing, reusing and recycling, and of course, we’ll all wear GREEN! \r\n\r\nThursday
      will be Be Bright; Turn Out the Light Day. Students will learn about energy
      conservation, and since we’ll try to save as much energy as possible, be sure
      to wear something really bright to light up our school without using energy!
      \r\n\r\nFriday we will promote the importance of planting trees and native plants. 
      Friday is Color the Earth Day.  Wear as many colors of the rainbow as you can
      – and throw on a hat, too, because…why not? \r\n\r\nStart looking through your
      closet today so you’re all ready for AES Earth Day Week when you return from
      spring break. We can’t wait to celebrate by Coloring Our Earth with Kindness!"

      unacceptable levels across the country and children are most acutely at risk
      during the summer, when they do not have access to school meals. In 2015, about
      3.8 million children received Summer Meals - far fewer than the 21 million children
      who receive free or reduced price lunches through the National School Lunch
      Program during the school year. This means that during the summer we are not
      reaching the vast majority of children who rely on school meals to meet their
      nutritional needs. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates summer
      meals programs to address this problem. \r\n\r\nWe are pleased to inform you
      that our 2019 Open Site Summer Meals Program will begin on Tuesday, June 25,
      2019 and run through Wednesday, August 21, 2019. The program hours will vary
      from location to location. All children 18 years of age and younger who drop
      in at any of the sites may receive free meals. Parents or guardians do not need
      to apply to get these summer meals for their children. \r\n\r\nIf you have any
      questions or want to see a list of sites and their hours, please contact HCPSS
      Food and Nutrition Service at 410-313-7134 or at www.hcpss.org/food-services.

      students and keeping things organized! \n\n\t\t\t\tIn addition to the new students
      and families that will join us this school year, we will also welcome several
      new staff members.  We look forward to greeting the smiling faces of new and
      returning students and working and learning with our new and returning staff
      members.  Our theme for this school year is “Constructing Great Minds and Building
      a Strong Foundation.”  The AES staff will work collaboratively to support and
      maintain a positive school culture and learning environment for all, where everyone
      is valued, connected, supported and appreciated.  It is through our collective
      efforts that we will reach all students, academically, socially and emotionally
      while encouraging and modeling how to be kind citizens, problem solvers and
      creative thinkers.  \n\n\t\t\t\tAs the summer comes to an end it begins a new
      and exciting chapter.  In addition to the excitement, the new year brings new
      experiences and new opportunities to learn and grow.  The road ahead is paved
      and ready to be traveled!  Undoubtedly, the road will have its share of twists
      and turns but, it will be traveled in great company with our students, staff
      and community.  We are excited to see the difference we are going to make this
      year! \n\n\t\t\t\tOur phones, email inboxes, and doors are always open for feedback,
      questions, and suggestions.  We look forward to serving each of you! \n\n\t\t\t\tBest,

      6-7pm \n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tFirst Day of School Information and
      Reminders \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tEvery child’s safety is important and we
      need your help. It remains our highest priority to ensure that students are
      dropped off and picked up daily in a safe and organized manner.  We are reminding
      everyone to follow the pick-up, drop-off procedures.  Failure to do so creates
      chaos, and unsafe conditions for our students, parents, and staff.  Please be
      kind to our staff and community members that may be directing traffic and guiding
      students. \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tSchoolwide Arrival \n\n\t\t\t\tPlease have
      your child come to school the way he/she will come to school every day.  We
      will have staff boarding buses and placing bus number tags on backpacks.  All
      bus riders will be escorted into the building. Our walkers and car riders will
      enter through the rear entrance doors.  Doors will open at 9:00 a.m.  Any student
      arriving after 9:15 a.m. must be accompanied by an adult to the front office.
      \n\n\t\t\t\tKindergarten students that attend the Open House will receive a
      nametag necklace specific to the assigned to teacher.  If families are unable
      to attend the Open House, the kindergarten student will receive a nametag the
      first day of school.  Staff will guide the kindergarteners off the bus and escort
      them to class.  Kindergarten staff will also meet walkers and car riders at
      the back of the school next to the blacktop.  Students in grades 1-5 will be
      directed to their classrooms.  Staff will be available throughout the building
      to assist all students.  We ask parents/guardians to say goodbye at home and
      at the front or rear door of the school.  Thank you for understanding. \n\n\t\t\t\tDuring
      arrival, between 8:50 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. orange cones will be placed along the
      crosswalk at the back of the school. During this time cars cannot enter or exit
      the rear parking lot.  Persons that enter the parking lot prior to 8:50 a.m.
      will be asked to remain in the parking lot until 9:15 a.m. \n\n\t\t\t\tPlease
      do not leave your child without supervision. There is no supervision for students
      until 9:00 a.m. \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tAM Drop Off \n\n\t\t\t\tParents/guardians
      driving children to school should use the Atholton Park or park along Donleigh
      Drive.  Please do not park along the entrance or exit to Atholton Park.   Please
      be courteous of our neighbors and only park on one side of the street in the
      neighborhood. \n\n\t\t\t\tParents may also park on Groveleigh Drive and use
      the crosswalk to escort children across the street.  Please do not drop off
      children along Seneca Drive.  This is dangerous. \n\n\t\t\t\tAfter all buses
      have dropped off students, cars will be permitted to enter the bus loop, after
      9:15 a.m.   If your child arrives after 9:15, please park and walk your student
      to the main office to sign them in. \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tDismissal \n\n\t\t\t\tAll
      car riders, walkers, and students that participate in after school programs
      or attend after care centers will be dismissed at 3:38 p.m.  All bus riders
      will be dismissed at 3:45 p.m. \n\n\t\t\t\tPlease inform your child’s teacher
      in writing if dismissal is different than arrival.  During dismissal, our staff
      will ensure students get on the correct bus based on the bus they rode to school
      in the morning, or other information obtained in writing from the parent/guardian.
      \n\n\t\t\t\tPlease do not email to teachers to inform them of dismissal changes. 
      They will be with students and may not see your email.  Please call the school
      and speak to the office staff if your child’s dismissal procedures change and
      you did not provide a written note.  We will make certain the child’s teacher
      is informed. \n\n\t\t\t\tAll walkers will be escorted to the back of the school
      to meet their parent/guardian, or be escorted to the parent/guardian selected
      after care provider or program.  All walker/car rider kindergarten students
      will be dismissed from the rear kindergarten doors and be released to the parent/guardian,
      or designated adult for pick up. \n\n\t\t\t\tParents/guardians of walkers and
      car riders should park at Atholton Park and walk to the back of the school to
      meet their children.  If the Atholton Park lot is full, please do not park along
      the entrance to the park.  Please park along Donleigh. \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tBus
      Information \n\n\t\t\t\tIf your child rides a bus, please arrive at the bus
      stop 5-10 minutes before your bus is due to arrive in the morning.  Please allow
      some flexibility in morning and afternoon arrival times the first few weeks
      of school.  \n\n\t\t\t\tIt is very important to put your child on the bus on
      the first day. Students who ride buses will have their bus number tagged on
      their backpack with a wristband strip. Please leave the bus tag on their backpack.
      This will help staff escort students to the correct bus in the afternoon and
      throughout the school year. \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tFood Services \n\n\t\t\t\tOur
      Food and Nutrition Services web page has information parents/guardians may find
      helpful, including meal prices, how to pay for meals, where to view menus, nutritional
      and allergen information, and more. \n\n\t\t\t\tStudent Breakfast - $2.00        
                             Student Lunch - $2.75 \n\n\t\t\t\tReduced Breakfast -
      $.30                                Reduced Lunch - $.40 \n\n\t\t\t\tMilk -
      $.50 \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tParents/guardians of students who qualify for
      Free and Reduced Meals (FARMS) must submit a new application each school year.
      Students that qualified for free or reduced meals last school year will receive
      free or reduced lunch prices during the first 30 days of school. Details on
      the HCPSS FARMs program is online including how to apply. Please call the school
      if you have questions or need assistance. \n\n\t\t\t\tWe serve breakfast each
      morning from 9:00 a.m. to 9:15 a.m.  Students who wish to purchase breakfast
      may go directly to the cafeteria when they arrive. \n\n\t\t\t\tLunches are scheduled
      between 10:50 a.m. and 1:35 p.m. \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tPets \n\n\t\t\t\tWe
      love pets; however, for the safety of our students we ask that you not bring
      pets to school with you to drop off or pick up students. Effective August 29,
      2017 animals in schools or offices, leashed or not, present safety, environmental,
      and liability issues.  Students and staff may be exposed to potential physical
      hazards, such as bites, and/or allergy related health problems.  As a result,
      animals are prohibited within HCPSS buildings.  Animals are also prohibited
      on school system property during arrival, dismissal, recess or other HCPSS sponsored
      outdoor activities.  Service animals or service animals in training per MD Annotated
      Code Section 7-705 (Service Animals) and the American Disabilities Act (ADA)
      as well as animals approved for instructional purposes are exempt from this
      prohibition. \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tAdditional Information
      \n\n\t\t\t\tHow to Find the Name of Your Child’s Homeroom Teacher \n\n\t\t\t\tYou
      will only be able to access the name of your child’s homeroom teacher prior
      to our open house events if you complete your child’s Family File (emergency
      contact and dismissal information) on or before August 28th. Beginning on August
      28th, you will be able to view your child’s homeroom teacher when you log on
      to your HCPSS Connect account. See the directions below to update your Family
      File. As of today, only 47% of our students have updated emergency contact information.
      \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tUpdate your Child’s Emergency Contact and Dismissal
      Information \n\n\t\t\t\tIf you have not updated/completed your Family File,
      please take care of this as soon as possible at HCPSS Connect.  There are several
      resources to assist you in completing the emergency contact information. \n\n\t\t\t\tHCPSS
      Family File is where parents input and find all of the information located on
      their child's Emergency Procedure Cards, such as transportation, contact information,
      and medical considerations. To update your Family File, go to https://www.hcpss.org/connect/
      . For the safety of your child/children, it is very important that this information
      remains current. This information must be updated every year. Please ensure
      that it is completed prior to the start of school. For directions on how to
      input your child's information on Family file, click here. For frequently asked
      questions, click here. \n\n\t\t\t\tAs an additional bonus, families who fill
      out and update their family file information will find out their child’s homeroom
      teacher two days before our Open House! Don’t delay! Spread the word! \n\n\t\t\t\tParents
      who do not have, or may have forgotten their log-in credentials can request
      assistance using the help link in the HCPSS Connect page. If you need help,
      click here. \n\n\t\t\t\t  \n\n\t\t\t\tBus Routes \n\n\t\t\t\tBus numbers, routes,

      \n\n\t\t\t\t2019-2020 HCPSS Calendars \n\n\t\t\t\tThere will be no printed 2019-2020
      calendars provided by HCPSS this year.  Instead, families may add the online
      calendar to their own mobile/online calendar by: \n\n\t\t\t\t1. Going to https://www.hcpss.org/calendar/
      \n\t\t\t\t\t2. Scrolling down to Subscribing to a Calendar \n\t\t\t\t\t3. Right-clicking

      \n\n\t\t\t\tThe Student & Parent Handbook (https://www.hcpss.org/about-us/handbook/)
      will no longer be printed and instead will be available online.  The 2019-2020
      Student & Parent Handbook will be available by early September. \n\n\t\t\t\tThe
      handbook outlines districtwide practices and polices related to students and
      parents.  It additionally features sub-topics that describe various services,
      procedures, and protocols implemented in Howard County Public Schools. \n\n\t\t\t\tThe
      Student Code of Conduct can be found within the Student & Parent Handbook and

    body: 'School Meals


      A stopgap U.S. government funding bill signed into law last Thursday, which
      includes almost $8 billion in nutrition assistance, allows USDA to extend the
      meal waivers, previously due to expire at the end of December, through the end
      of the 2020-2021 school year. Thus, HCPSS will be able to provide meals at no
      cost to any HCPSS student, and all children 18 and under, through the entire
      school year, assuming continued availability of USDA funding.  


       


      Beginning Monday, October 12, HCPSS will add a snack and dinner to each weekday
      meal, in addition to breakfast and lunch already being served. Additionally,
      weekend meals will be included with meals provided on Fridays, and in pre-ordered
      meals picked up on Thursdays.


       


      HCPSS also has adjusted the pre-order process. Meals for multiple days need
      to be pre-ordered at least two days in advance for pickup on Mondays and Thursdays.
      Pre-order meal pickups will be offered only on those two days, to enable Food
      and Nutrition Services to improve service and efficiency while balancing staffing
      and food resources.


       


      Full details on HCPSS student meal offerings can be found online.'

      schedule of synchronous and asynchronous assignments. During the first synchronous
      session for each related arts class (i.e. PE, Music, Art, Media, Technology)
      your child’s related arts teacher will communicate with the students how to
      best navigate the course and identify where students will obtain weekly assignments
      and lessons. Students will not be responsible or required to complete asynchronous
      assignments for any related arts until they have their first synchronous (live)
      class with their Related Arts teacher. You can find the synchronous Related
      Arts class schedule on the Canvas Calendar along with the link to access the
      Google Meet live synchronous session. \r\n\r\nThe Related Arts Team will send
      a weekly announcement to students and families to share what they are to do
      each week.  Additionally, students' Canvas to-do list will also reflect the
      classes with assignments."

      will be once a month. Students will also be expected to practice outside of
      their synchronous meetings. The best part is that students will not miss synchronous
      instruction from their other classes! This is a fantastic opportunity for your
      young musicians to break up the flow of their school day by moving, learning
      something new, and making music with their friends and music teachers. \n\nWe
      enjoyed meeting all your young musicians this past week in their classes and
      look forward to meeting all of you next week at our Band, Strings, and Chorus
      Back to School Night. Join Mrs. Dinning, Mrs. Clavell, and Mr. Piccirelli to
      talk about opportunities for Band, Strings, and Chorus this year. We will talk
      about how to register, class schedules, student expectations, and required materials.
      We look forward to meeting you and answering any questions you may have. \n\nYou
      are welcome to find information about the Band and Strings programs at the websites
      below. We have also included the direct link to sign up for Band, Strings, and

      possibilities for a hybrid instructional model for the second semester, beginning
      February 1, 2021, which could include opportunities for in-person instruction.
      A hybrid model could provide an option for parents/guardians to send their child
      to school part of the week and learn virtually for the remainder of the week.
      \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis fall, there will be significant public discussion
      and consideration around the second semester. At this time, HCPSS is seeking
      to understand families’ intentions regarding sending their students back to
      school, if that option becomes available, or continuing fully virtual learning.
      Please see directions below for accessing this questionnaire. Please note, this
      is separate from the small group instruction survey that some families have
      received. Additionally, it is crucial for planning to know if students who qualify
      to receive bus service would use it. Parent/guardian response is not a commitment
      for the second semester; you will be able to change your decision when plans
      for second semester are finalized. Your intention at this time will help facilitate
      planning. To complete the form: \r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLog

      additional services. These supplemental digital tools are approved by HCPSS
      and comply with federal, state and Howard County Board of Education student
      data privacy policies. Due to Google’s settings, students must access this set
      of tools by utilizing Google’s menu of additional services, which requires consent
      by a parent or guardian. \n\nTo provide consent: \n\n\n\tLog in to HCPSS Connect.
      \n\tSelect More Options from the left panel. \n\tSelect HCPSS Google Menu from
      the middle of the page. \n\tClick the check box to provide consent. Changes
      are saved automatically. \n\n\nA parent or guardian must provide consent for
      each student by selecting the student’s name at the top of the page.  \n\nThe
      digital tools currently included are: Book Room, Word Work, Scratch BluBot, Scratch
      JR, Sketch-Up, Collector Classic, JamBoard, Google Earth and Minecraft: Education.
      After a parent/guardian provides consent, students using a HCPSS Chromebook
      can access the tools through the Google Play Store icon on the Chromebook when
      logged in with an HCPSS account. There may be a delay of up to three days before
      the apps appear in the Google menu and some tools may automatically appear on
      the Chromebook once consent is provided by a parent or guardian without the
      need to install them. If your child has not been issued a Chromebook, please
      make the request following the information found online. \n\nPlease note: \n\n\n\tHCPSS
      cannot guarantee that apps are available on devices other than HCPSS Chromebooks.
      \n\tTeachers may or may not choose to use any or all of these apps during instruction.
      Students will be notified when a particular app will be used for instruction.
      \n\tIf you do not provide consent for your student’s access to these digital
      tools, your student’s teacher will provide alternative enrichment activities.
      \n\tIn addition to these Google tools, HCPSS has approved a robust set of supplemental
      digital tools. Your child’s teacher will notify you of the particular supplemental
      digital tools being used in each class via email or on their Canvas course page.

      in the "Live Virtual Read Aloud"! This was a great way to connect with staff
      and families outside of school while adhering to social distancing. If we have

      it has been that if we want to stay connected, we will. We look forward to hosting

      updates related to the start of the 2021-2022 school year.  Below is additional
      information regarding cafeteria updates that was shared with the community on
      Friday, August 20.  \n\nAES will offer an outdoor lunch option for students
      as weather and staffing permits.  We will keep the community updated as the
      plan is developed. \n\nPlease help us plan by completing this form by noon on
      Wednesday, August 25. \n\nPlease complete a form for each child.   \n\nIf you
      have any questions, please contact Dr. Holden or Mrs. Krabiin at 410-313-6853
      or by email at Shawna_holden@hcpss.org or Melanie_Krablin@hcpss.org. \n\nSincerely,
      \n\nDr. Holden & Mrs. Krablin \n\nCafeteria Updates (August 20th Message) \n\nThere
      are several updates related to cafeteria protocols to further reduce the risk
      of the spread of COVID-19. All schools will have outdoor eating spaces available
      on campus for student use as weather and staffing permits to lessen the number
      of students in the cafeteria. In an effort to maintain a healthy environment
      in cafeterias, the following actions are being implemented:  \n\n\n\tAdditional
      tables have been ordered and will be distributed to schools to help ensure outside
      eating areas are furnished as well as to allow maximum spacing indoors. \L \n\tBased
      on the availability of products from vendors, large tents that are compliant
      with local code will be provided to elementary schools to increase outdoor dining
      spaces. We anticipate a number of tents will be in place to begin the school
      year with additional tents being provided in September.\L \n\tPlexiglass shields
      for indoor cafeteria tables are being secured for grades k-6 where students
      are largely unable to be vaccinated. These panels will provide additional protection
      between students who are unable to be vaccinated while eating when masks cannot
      be worn."

      an important role in supporting teachers and creating a connection between teachers
      and families. Some responsibilities include caring for classroom teachers and
      support staff, creating a class directory for class distribution, facilitating
      communication between teachers and families, and assisting with special activities.

      school experience. Membership is a primary source of funds each year, allowing
      PTA to offer great programs and activities at AES. Membership is open to parents,
      guardians, grandparents, extended family, community, faculty & staff. Other
      perks of joining PTA include free AES PTA car magnet (I know those Kindergarten
      families are excited for these!) & entry in raffles for priority parking at

      \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n    The Atholton Elementary School Book Club gives families
      a meaningful way to recognize students on their birthdays and contribute to
      the AES media center collection. Each donated book will have a bookplate that
      includes your child’s name, birthday and the donor’s name. The book will be
      presented during media class and your student will be the first person to borrow
      the book. These gifts create a lasting tribute and give our students a great
      sense of pride when they see the inscription inside the front cover. \r\n\r\n 
      \r\n\r\n      If you would like to make a contribution to honor your child,
      please complete the form below and return it to the front office with a check
      made out to AES PTA. A donation of $15.00 allows us to select quality books.
      Please assist us by printing information accurately and completely. Please send
      in your request by Mar 10, 2022 to allow processing time. Books will be presented

    title: AES Continues as a Green School
    body: "It's official...Atholton has successfully qualified as Maryland Green School
      at the highest possible level, known as Sustainable. This award has been 14
      years in the making, so it was quite a treat to be informed of the good news
      on the evening of Earth Day. To become a certified Maryland Green School, a
      rigorous set of standards must be documented, to include environmental instruction
      throughout the school, student-driven best-management practices to promote sustainability,
      environmental staff professional learning, school-wide environmental celebrations/events,
      and partnership with the community to carry out our goals. We began this mission
      in 2007, receiving our first certification and Green School flag in 2009. The
      following three certifications would be awarded, through rigorous application,
      every four years, documenting four years of Green School activity per application.
      Check out our incredible Green School application, which electronically documents
      years 2010 through 2022. 2007 through 2009 were captured in hard copy through
      two 4-inch, magnificent binders of documentation. As you peruse our electronic
      application, you will see years and years of dedication to incorporating Green
      School values at AES, serving as a model for our community. Did you know we
      have a beautiful native garden? Have you been to our outdoor classroom? Did
      you know we raise and release Trout and Monarch butterflies every year? Have
      you seen the amazing recycled sculptures our students create each year for America
      Recycles Day? Has your family participated in Bike to School Day? Has your child
      been involved in a scout troop that volunteers to support our Green School?
      Did you know we have student recyclers at AES? We have countless examples of
      the work we continue to do to support our amazing Green School. Thank you for
      your support over the years. Our work is not yet done. We will forge on to ensure
      Atholton continues to operate with the environment in mind. And though our next
      application, four years from now, will look a little different from what we
      have submitted previously, we will still be held accountable by the Maryland
      Association of Environmental Outdoor Education for the Green School efforts
      we make. Congratulations on Sustainability, Atholton! \n\n \n\nEarth Day Scavenger
      Hunt Drawing Winners\n\n\n\tAtholton received 261 student scavenger hunts after
      this year's Earth Day Week. Way to go, green Panthers! Four drawing winners
      were announced and awarded on Tuesday this week. Congratulations to Bryce in
      3rd grade, who won an adorable plush sea turtle with a shell that unzips to
      show its three little baby sea turtles. Other winners, who received youth sets
      of binoculars, were Amen and Layla in 2nd grade, and Korra in Pre-K. Thank you
      for participating in the Earth Day scavenger hunt!"

      Crew empty glue stick collection.  During the past few school years, we have
      collected between 1,500 and 2,000 empty glue sticks per year, sending them off
      for upcycling and keeping them out of our landfills.  They are then turned into
      something else, like a park bench or a school carpet.  What's more, our school
      receives 2 cents for every glue stick we send to Terracycle.  (That's where
      the "jingle" comes in.)  This year, we will collect glue sticks in Pringles
      chip cans.  Each classroom will have a can, which will be covered to look like
      a giant glue stick!  We need your help.  If you have empty Pringles cans to
      donate to the school, please send them in with your child to be delivered to
      Mrs. Young.  We would like to begin this year's glue stick collection as soon
      as possible, so send in your cans as you use them.  Thank you so much for your
      assistance.

      We are using this theme to encourage our families and staff to engage in some
      Earth Day Week activities: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tStarting this weekend and running all
      week, through next weekend, AES families are encouraged to take 'selfies' of
      any Earth-friendly transportation they engage in to get somewhere, which could
      include walking, bike-riding, carpooling, or taking a bus.  Selfies should include
      everyone involved and should be sent to Mrs. Simon in the front office (michelle_simon@hcpss.org). 
      She will print them out and put them on a bulletin board in our front hallway. 
      Our goal is to fill up the board with pictures of our students and staff using
      Earth-Friendly ways to get around in our community.  When you email your selfie
      to Mrs. Simon, be sure to explain the photo. \r\n\tAn \"Earth-Friendly Transportation\"
      survey can be found in today's Friday folders.  Please consider reading the
      directions to fill out one or more portion(s) of the survey.  Each portion returned
      to school will serve as a submission for daily drawings during morning announcements. 
      Surveys will get shared on announcements and posted on our hallway tree.  We
      look forward to hearing how the families of our school consider the Earth while
      getting from one place to another. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll students were presented this
      information by fifth grade Green Ambassadors during Thursday's lunch shifts. 
      Students were told parents would also receive this information in the Panther
      Press.  Thank you for participating in Atholton's Earth Day fun.  As always,
      we will continue our Waste-free lunches, recycling, and our regular environmental
      instruction   Have a wonderful Earth Day Week; hope you can get outside to enjoy
      NATURE!"

      is through immunization.  \r\n\tMost cases of the flu usually happen in February
      so December and January are not too late to be vaccinated; however, \r\n\tYou
      may be able to get Injectable or intranasal vaccine now at your child's doctor's
      office or community immunizers like pharmacies.  \r\n\tIf your child gets a
      flu vaccination or any other type of immunization between now and the school
      flu clinic, and you have previously consented to have your child vaccinated
      at school, please alert your school nurse at 410-313-7429. \r\n\tWe continue
      to plan for our flu clinic so, if you have not already, please return your child's
      flu consent form by October 30.  Having these forms will make sure we're ready
      for the December clinics.  We also will be prepared if FluMist becomes available
      sooner. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe appreciate your patience and cooperation and will be
      in touch about the new flu clinic date.  In the meantime, if you have not already,
      please return your child's FluMist consent form by October 30.    \r\n\r\n "

    body: "We will continue the Atholton tradition of having a Halloween Parade outside
      of the school followed by class parties for the students on October 29st at
      2:45.  The community is invited to the parade.  The PTA is providing the food
      for the party except for a couple of items the room parents are taking care
      of.  Please do not send in additional food items. Room parents will be organizing
      volunteers for the class parties based on the number requested by the teacher.
       Volunteers will not be able to bring siblings. Due to space, only volunteers
      asked to assist with the party will be able to come into the building after
      the parade.  As children begin the process of choosing a costume, please remind
      them that they will not be able to bring any toy weapons to school and gory/bloody
      make-up should be saved for parties/trick-or-treating outside of school.  Students
      will bring their costumes to school in a bag. We will have an alternative activity
      planned for students not participating in the parade or party.  Please send
      a note to your child’s teacher if your child will be participating in the alternative
      activity. \r\n\r\nThe following ingredients are in the cookies and pretzels
      being served at the party.  Please send in an alternative snack if your child
      is allergic to any of the items.  In addition to water and clementines: \r\n\r\nSugar
      cookie: wheat flour, sugar, vegetable shortening, dried egg yolks, soy protien,
      nonfat dried milk, salt, baking soda, corn starch, vanilla flavor, corn syrup
      solids / icing: sugar, water, corn syrup. Contains wheat, egg, soy and dairy

      sad to leave the students and families, as well as my colleagues, at Atholton.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p
      style=\"text-autospace:none\"><span style=\"color:black\">It has been my honor
      and privilege to serve the Atholton Elementary community as principal. I want
      to thank the students and parents for all the support I received over the past
      three and a half years as we collaboratively worked to boost the achievement
      of all our students. &nbsp;</span>I tell people all the time that I have the
      best job in the world!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been able to go to work and spend
      my day with 425 beautiful children and 75 very talented adults.&nbsp; I have
      also come to know the families and have enjoyed working with an amazing PTA.&nbsp;
      Thank you for all your support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-autospace:none\"><span
      style=\"color:black\">I am pleased to share that Ms. Shawna Holden will be the
      new principal of Atholton. She is an experienced principal from Prince George&rsquo;s
      County. &nbsp;I will be meeting with Ms. Holden and our assistant principal,
      Miss Secula, to ensure a smooth transition for the opening of the new school
      year. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-autospace:none\">There will be opportunities
      for parents and students to meet Ms. Holden this summer. She will be sending
      additional communications soon introducing herself and sharing details about
      meeting with the school community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-autospace:none\"><span

      to work with your children and for supporting me during my time as the proud
      principal of Atholton Elementary School; it is truly a special place. I wish
      each of you continued success and happiness.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-autospace:none\"><span

      to have the opportunity to be a member of such a great learning community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During
      the past few weeks, I have had interactions with school staff and county leaders.&nbsp;
      From these conversations, it is clear there is a collegial partnership between
      all stakeholders to provide the best academic experience for our students.&nbsp;
      I look forward to fostering these relationships and working with the staff and
      community to provide a world-class educational opportunity for each child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I
      have been dedicated to the field of education for more than 15 years and began
      my teaching career here in Howard County at Talbott Springs Elementary School.&nbsp;
      My most recent administrative experience has been shaped by four years of successful
      leadership as an Elementary Principal (grades PreK-6), four years as an Instructional
      Specialist (K-12), and three years as an Assistant Principal.&nbsp; I am elated
      to bring my skills as an instructional leader to Atholton, and to work collaboratively
      with staff, students and parents to ensure the success of all students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along
      with staff, I will work to continue and build upon the legacy of success that
      has been established at Atholton Elementary by building strong relationships
      with staff, parents, students, and the community.&nbsp; Our main goal is to
      ensure that every student is provided the highest quality education in a safe
      and supportive environment.&nbsp; We will use data to inform instruction and
      provide exciting and rigorous enrichment opportunities for all students.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My
      door is always open and I welcome your input.&nbsp; I invite you to call, visit,
      schedule an appointment, or send me an email (<a href=\"mailto:Shawna_holden@hcpss.org\">Shawna_holden@hcpss.org</a>)
      to discuss any concerns, suggestions, or ideas.&nbsp; I am eager to begin what
      promises to be a great year.&nbsp; To facilitate our ongoing communication and
      collaboration, I invite you to attend a Meet and Greet session, dates will be
      announced in the near future.&nbsp; I look forward to meeting and talking with
      you and your family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shawna Holden, Ed.D.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Principal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

      and the school profit was $540.00.&nbsp; Your thoughtfulness and generosity
      is appreciated!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank
      you for joining us today for the Fall Festival, Halloween party and parade.&nbsp;
      A special thank you to our awesome PTA and room parents for providing snacks
      and supporting classroom teachers during the fall festivities. Everyone had
      a GREAT time! The fall season is officially upon us! Before this enchanting
      season passes by, be sure to indulge in fall activities by running through pumpkin
      patches, grabbing a cup of warm cider or going on a hayride. What an exciting
      way to end the month!</p>\r\n"

      be contagious (such as strep throat, conjunctivitis, mumps, chicken pox etc.),
      please let the health room know, so that we may observe for additional cases.
      The health room tracks communicable diseases such as strep throat, conjunctivitis

    body: "<p>The Hour of Code is a global movement reaching tens of millions of students
      in 180+ countries that takes place during Computer Science Education Week.&nbsp;
      The Hour of Code started as a one-hour introduction to computer science, designed
      to demystify &quot;code&quot;, to show that anybody can learn the basics, and
      to broaden participation in the field of computer science. It has since become
      a worldwide effort to celebrate computer science, starting with 1-hour coding
      activities but expanding to all sorts of opportunities.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n\tYour
      child will be completing an Hour of Code in Technology during the week of December
      5th - 9th.&nbsp; Be sure to ask them all about it!&nbsp; <a href=\"http://www.hourofcode.org\"

      to get somewhere, which could include walking, bike-riding, carpooling, or taking
      a bus. Selfies should include everyone involved and should be sent to Mrs. Simon

      you for participating in Atholton&#39;s Earth Day fun. As always, we will continue
      our Waste-free lunches, recycling, and our regular environmental instruction.
      Each class will take some time outside of its four walls to get some fresh air
      during instruction. Have a wonderful Earth Day Week; we hope you can get outside
      to enjoy NATURE, too!</span></p>

      different than arrival.&nbsp; At dismissal our staff will ensure students: get
      on the correct bus based on the bus they rode to school in the morning, go to
      CA, or go to the back of the school to meet their parent(s).&nbsp; Parents of
      walkers and car riders should park in the Atholton Park and walk up to the back
      of the school to meet their children.&nbsp; If the Atholton Park lot is full,
      please park along Donleigh Drive. Kindergarten students will be dismissed from
      the rear Kindergarten doors, please look for the directional signage. To ensure
      a safe dismissal, cars are not able to park in the school lot at dismissal.

      front hallway of the school.&nbsp; Sculptures will remain on display through
      Friday, Nov. 17th for American Education Week. All participants will receive

    body: "<p>Flu season is in full swing and we have had a few reported cases at
      AES. A stomach virus has also been reported at many HCPSS schools. This is a
      reminder that good hand washing and covering sneezes and coughs with tissues
      and sleeves are essential steps to preventing the spread of &quot;germs.&quot;
      Also, remember that despite concerns about school attendance, your children&#39;s
      health (and the health of other children) is most important of all. For this
      reason, we ask you to please:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><u>Call the school nurse
      to let us know if your child is absent with a contagious illness such as strep
      throat, or the flu etc</u>. Please provide any documentation from your physician
      about diagnosis and release to return to school.</li>\r\n\t<li><u>Keep your
      child home if he/she has a fever of over 100.0.</u> If you give your child Motrin
      or Tylenol, this will bring your child&rsquo;s temperature down, but he/she
      will still be contagious to others.</li>\r\n\t<li><u>Children must be fever-free
      for 24 hours (without medication) before returning to school!</u></li>\r\n\t<li><u>Have
      your children wash their hands properly after using the restrooms and prior
      to eating</u>.</li>\r\n\t<li><u>If the doctor prescribes medication for your
      child, please make sure he/she takes it as directed</u>-which means the right
      amount at the right time and without missing doses.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In
      addition to colds and flu, winter is often a time when head lice (pediculosis)
      is seen. Please be aware of persistent head scratching and check your child&#39;s
      hair. Divide the hair in sections and look for lice or nits (hatched egg casings)
      attached to the hair shaft, pay special attention to areas around the ears and
      nape of neck. Lice are about the size of a sesame seed and are grayish/brown.
      They will scatter when you expose them to light, so if you think you saw one,
      you probably did. Remember, head lice do not carry disease and are in no way
      a reflection of a person&#39;s hygiene or cleanliness. Please refer to the CDC
      website for more information on head lice (pediculosis) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/lice/\"
      target=\"_blank\">www.cdc.gov/lice/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you very much for
      helping keep all our students healthy!</p>\r\n"

    body: "<p>Dear HCPSS Community:<br />\n\tNow that we have had a fourth inclement
      weather-related closing, I want to give you an update on the school calendar
      for the remainder of this year.</p>\n\n<p>Our academic calendar designates five
      possible inclement weather make-up days: February 19, April 4, 5, and 6, and
      June 15. Using February 19 (President&rsquo;s Day) would have required a state
      waiver, as it is a state mandated holiday, and would have caused significant
      budget <span class=\"highlight\" id=\"0.5203162149177882\" name=\"searchHitInReadingPane\">press</span>ures.
      Instead, the Board of Education has approved the use May 18 in lieu of February
      19 as a make-up day.</p>\n\n<p>After carefully reviewing our options, I want
      to provide you with the following information as well as my rationale about
      specific days to be used to make up school closings. I understand that any mid-year
      changes to the calendar can be disappointing, especially to students and families
      who have already made plans. Please be aware that our primary consideration
      in making these decisions is a commitment to quality instruction. We also wanted
      to provide you a level of predictability as we look ahead to the rest of the
      school year.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Schools
      now will be in session on April 4, 5, and 6 and for a half-day on May 18 to
      make up for the four inclement weather days used.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If schools are closed for one additional inclement
      weather day, June 15 will be used.<br />\n\t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;State law mandates that the school year must be completed by June 15.
      If additional inclement weather closings become necessary, HCPSS will petition
      the Maryland State Department of Education for a waiver of the additional days.</p>\n\n<p>The
      fifth possible make-up day on June 15 falls on a Muslim holiday. Per Board policy,
      no activities or exams can be scheduled on this day. This will require all end
      of school assemblies, promotion ceremonies, celebrations and final exams to
      be held on June 14 but still require students to attend on the day after. As
      an educator and a parent, I know that adding an additional day to the end of
      the school year would not effectively replace the valuable instruction days
      lost to inclement weather. HCPSS will use June 15 as a last resort to ensure
      that makeup days will truly serve as replacement days for the instruction time
      that has been lost.</p>\n\n<p>We will continue to carefully weigh all decisions
      to close school when inclement weather threatens the safety of students and
      staff, and will notify families as soon as possible should any additional changes
      to the school calendar become necessary. For more information on the <a href=\"http://www.hcpss.org/calendar/\"

    body: "<p><strong>TEN YEARS OF BEING GREEN (And Eleven at the End of This School
      Year!)</strong><br />\r\n\tThis year&rsquo;s AES Earth Day Week theme is Ten
      Years of Being Green, so our fourth grade Green Ambassadors came up with a school-wide
      plan for a home-to-school connection: Each class will develop a Top Ten list
      of what students do at home to be green citizens.&nbsp; Since this activity
      will prompt some discussion during class, we wanted to give our families an
      opportunity to have a discussion about this topic at home first. What do you
      do as a family at home to promote Earth-Friendly practices? Have your child
      share your family&#39;s contribution to leaving a smaller footprint. We can&#39;t
      wait to hear how AES families are making a difference!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>EARTH
      DAY WEEK GREEN BINGO &amp; DRAWING!</strong><br />\r\n\tOur fourth grade Green
      Ambassadors have come up with a Green Bingo board to use at home to promote
      being environmentally friendly. If your child completes the Green Bingo board
      and returns it signed by an adult, s/he will be entered in a drawing to win
      one of two prizes - the adorable picture book, titled I am Earth by Rebecca
      and James McDonald, or a very cute plush Earth. The deadline to return the completed
      and signed Bingo board will be Friday, April 27th, and the winner will be announced
      Monday, April 30th.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&quot;SHOW &#39;N GREEN&quot;</strong><br
      />\r\n\tGreen Ambassadors also came up with this great idea.&nbsp; Instead of
      &ldquo;Show &#39;n Tell,&rdquo; students can bring in something to share with
      the class that has something to do with being green. This is a great opportunity
      for your child to get up and share a bit about your green ways at home - and
      hopefully motivate others to do the same!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>ENDANGERED SPECIES
      - TECHNOLOGY</strong><br />\r\n\tTwo of our fourth grade Green Ambassadors,
      Cassia B. and Olivia T., have been collaborating with Mrs. Muir to create Technology
      class lesson plans for all grades to engage in during Earth Day Week. Ask your
      child which animal s/he chose to learn about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>STRAW AWARENESS</strong><br
      />\r\n\tA small group of fifth graders took it upon themselves to put together
      a presentation for each grade to watch during their lunch shifts. This presentation
      is about the negative impacts straws can have on our environment. These past
      fourth grade Green Ambassadors are passionate about the environment and hope
      to ignite a reduction in straw usage at AES.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS</strong><br
      />\r\n\tEach day during Earth Day Week, fourth grade Green Ambassadors will
      share a few facts during morning announcements to start each day off with a
      reminder we must keep the Earth in mind as we live our daily lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a

      find out what we do with all those empty glue sticks and dried up markers while
      you&#39;re at it.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>INDIVIDUAL CLASS ACTIVITIES</strong><br
      />\r\n\tIn addition to these school-wide Earth Day Week activities, your child
      will engage in instructional activities in their own classrooms to celebrate
      Earth Day Week. Don&#39;t forget to ask your child what they have been doing
      at school to recognize the importance of taking care of our planet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>HAPPY

    body: '<p>Hello Kindergarten Families,</p>


      <p>Before school starts we would like to take a little bit of time to get to
      know your child by administering some preliminary reading assessments as shared
      in the March 5th Welcome Letter. These assessments will help provide your child&#39;s
      teacher with information to guide instruction and differentiate to best meet
      your child&#39;s needs.&nbsp; We will conduct these assessments on August 27th
      from 9:00am -11:40am.</p>


      <p>Please call the school to sign up for a 20-minute time slot starting on August
      15th between 9:00am -3:00pm.</p>


      <p>If you are unable to bring your child on August 27th please do not be concerned.&nbsp;
      We will also conduct these assessments the first few weeks of school.</p>


      <p>We are excited to meet our new Kindergarten families.</p>

    body: "<p>We are looking forward to seeing your children Tuesday morning.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Every
      child&rsquo;s safety is important to us and we need your help. It remains our
      highest priority to ensure that students are dropped off and picked up daily
      in a safe and organized manner.&nbsp; We are reminding everyone to follow the
      pick-up, drop-off procedures.&nbsp; Failure to do so creates chaos, and unsafe
      conditions for our students, parents, and staff.&nbsp; Please be kind to our
      staff and community members that may be directing traffic and guiding students.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Schoolwide
      Arrival</strong></p>\n\n<p>Please have your child come to school the way he/she
      will come to school every day.&nbsp; We will have staff boarding buses and placing
      bus number tags on backpacks.&nbsp; All bus riders will be escorted into the
      building. Our walkers and car riders will enter through the rear entrance doors.&nbsp;
      Doors will open at 9:00 a.m.&nbsp; Any student arriving after 9:15 a.m. must
      be accompanied by an adult to the front office.</p>\n\n<p>Kindergarten students
      should wear the nametags they received during Kindergarten Orientation.&nbsp;
      Do not worry, kindergarteners of families who were unable to attend the Kindergarten
      Orientation or Open House will receive a nametag.&nbsp; Staff will guide the
      kindergarteners off the bus.&nbsp; Kindergarten staff will also meet walkers
      and car riders at the back of the school.&nbsp; Students in grades 1-5 will
      be directed to their classrooms.&nbsp; Staff will be available throughout the
      building to assist all students.&nbsp; We ask parents/guardians to say goodbye
      at home and at the front or rear door of the school.&nbsp; Thank you for understanding.</p>\n\n<p>During
      arrival, between 8:50 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. orange cones will be placed along the
      crosswalk at the back of the school. During this time cars cannot enter or exit
      the rear parking lot.&nbsp; Persons that enter the parking lot prior to 8:50
      a.m. will be asked to remain in the parking lot until 9:15 a.m.</p>\n\n<p>Please
      do not leave your child without supervision. There is no supervision for students
      until 9:00 a.m.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>AM Drop Off</strong></p>\n\n<p>Parents/guardians
      driving children to school should use the Atholton Park or park along Donleigh
      Drive.&nbsp; Please do not park along the entrance or exit to the Atholton Park.&nbsp;
      NO PARKING signs will be posted along the park entrance as a reminder.&nbsp;
      Please be courteous of our neighbors and only park on one side of the street
      in the neighborhood.</p>\n\n<p>Parents may also park on Groveleigh Drive and
      use the crosswalk to escort children across the street.&nbsp; Please do not
      drop off children along Seneca Drive.&nbsp; This is dangerous.&nbsp; STOP NO
      STUDENT DROP OFF OR PICK UP signs will be posted as a reminder.</p>\n\n<p>After
      all buses have dropped off students, cars will be permitted to enter the bus
      loop, after 9:15 a.m.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Dismissal</strong></p>\n\n<p>All
      car riders, walkers, and students that participate in after school programs
      or attend after care centers will be dismissed at 3:37 p.m.&nbsp; All bus riders
      will be dismissed at 3:45 p.m.</p>\n\n<p>Please inform your child&rsquo;s teacher
      in writing if dismissal is different than arrival.&nbsp; During dismissal, our
      staff will ensure students get on the correct bus based on the bus they rode
      to school in the morning, or other information obtained in writing from the
      parent/guardian.&nbsp; All walkers will be escorted to the back of the school
      to meet their parent/guardian, or be escorted to the parent/guardian selected
      after care provider or program.&nbsp; All walker/car rider kindergarten students
      will be dismissed from the rear kindergarten doors and be released to the parent/guardian,
      or designated adult for pick up.</p>\n\n<p>Parents/guardians of walkers and
      car riders should park in the Atholton Park and walk to the back of the school
      to meet their children.&nbsp; If the Atholton Park lot is full, please do not
      park along the entrance to the park.&nbsp; Please park along Donleigh.</p>\n\n<p>To
      ensure a safe dismissal, cars are not able to park in the school lot during
      dismissal.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Bus Information</strong></p>\n\n<p>If
      your child rides a bus, please arrive at the bus stop 5-10 minutes before your
      bus is due to arrive in the morning.&nbsp; Please allow some flexibility in
      AM and PM arrival times the first week or two of school.</p>\n\n<p>It is very
      important to put your child on the bus on the first day. Students who ride buses
      will have their bus number tagged on their backpack with a wristband strip.
      Please leave the bus tag on their backpack. This will help staff escort students
      to the correct bus in the afternoon and throughout the school year.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Positive
      Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS)</strong></p>\n\n<p>We will continue
      to use PBIS and the 3Rs &ndash; Respectful, Ready and Responsible to highlight
      positive behavior.&nbsp; Teachers will spend time the first few weeks of school
      getting to know each learner and building community to create a positive learning
      environment that ensures equity in the classroom. This year we will enhance
      PBIS with 123 Magic. This program will support all staff with establishing and
      maintaining good discipline habits and encouraging courteous classroom behavior
      and constructive work habits.&nbsp; We look forward to scheduling a parent/guardian
      information night to share more information about how the program will be implemented
      at AES as well as ways the program can be implemented at home.</p>\n\n<p><br

    body: "<p><u>Dismissal for After School Programs AND any changes to a student&#39;s
      regular dismissal</u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please make sure to send a note in with
      your student if they will be dismissed in a different manner than usual. (I.E.
      usually rides the bus, but today will be a walker). This procedure also includes
      after school programs held at AES that student&#39;s have signed up for.(I.E.
      Please dismiss &quot;Susie&quot; to the soccer after school program today.&quot;)
      <strong>Classroom teachers require a note each time/day to ensure that your
      student is dismissed properly.</strong>&nbsp; Notes are not accepted with multiple
      dates.&nbsp; This keeps everyone (teacher/substitute) informed.&nbsp; For example,
      if the classroom teacher is out sick or has to leave suddenly, the person covering
      in the classroom would have no idea that a note had been sent in days earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students
      that attend the Columbia Association (CA) Aftercare program are <u>ALWAYS</u>
      dismissed to CA and the after school program leader will sign out the student
      from CA and sign them back into CA after the after school event is over.&nbsp;
      For this reason, <em>CA Aftercare participants DO NOT need a dismissal note
      for their classroom teacher.&nbsp;</em> Please note: the Columbia Association
      may have requirements regarding release of students from their program. Please
      adhere to any procedures that CA has in place for this process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If
      you forget to send a note in with your student, please call the front office
      to convey the change in dismissal.&nbsp;<strong> Emails to teachers are not
      recognized as a form of dismissal communication,</strong> again because the
      teacher may be absent, or may be with students all day and not see the message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      thank you in advance for your help in making sure that all 400+ of our students
      arrive to their destinations safely! If you have any questions or concerns,
      please call the school.</p>\r\n"

      <p>* It supports the new Special Education Strategic Plan for the county as
      a pilot for social competencies designed to foster relationship building among
      peers for a more caring/empathetic school environment.</p>


      <p>* It will empower and provide resources to families to have meaningful conversations
      about the differences that surround our world (e.g. physical, emotional, neurological,
      intellectual, socio-ecomical, cultural and religious differences) to help our
      children foster meaningful relationships and understand problems through the
      perspectives of others</p>

      Students will walk, jog, or run as many laps as they can around the course during

      for their team by moving the entire time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grades K-2 will have
      15 minutes and Grades 3-5 will have 20 minutes to earn as many laps as they
      can towards their team total!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Students will earn a popsicle stick
      for each lap they complete. Volunteers will place the popsicle sticks in the
      assigned team bin. Each grade level will have a class on the blue, white, and
      yellow team. At the end of the day, we will announce how many laps each team
      was able to complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your help is needed in order to make the
      Turkey Trot a success. We need volunteers to pass out popsicle sticks, ensure
      students are running the correct way and staying on the course. We would like
      to have 6 volunteers per grade. If a grade level has the number of volunteers
      requested, you can support the students during the Turkey Trot by cheering them
      on and watching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for your support!<br />\r\n\tMr. Trawick

      Team is hosting its tenth annual America Recycles Sculpture Expo from Nov. 12th
      through Nov. 16th. The goal of this event is to promote awareness about waste
      reduction and involve students in thinking creatively to reuse materials. Students
      in all grades are invited to use their creativity to construct a sculpture made
      entirely of recycled materials. Students may work independently or with a partner
      on this project. The sculptures may be purely artistic or based upon a character,
      animal, object, person, activity, event, etc. Sculptures should be brought to
      school on Monday, November 12th; they will be displayed in the front hallway
      of the school. Sculptures will remain on display through Friday, Nov. 16th for
      American Education Week. All participants will receive a recognition award certificate
      of participation. If your child is interested in participating in this opportunity,
      please complete the form that was sent home in the 10/26 Friday folder and return
      it to school by Friday, Nov. 9th. Siblings can submit their names on one form.

      Office will determine their eligibility status within 24-48 hours. Families
      that would not ordinarily qualify for the FARMs program could be eligible for
      the remainder of the school year because of the current loss of income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Families

      food insecurity remains at unacceptable levels across the country and children
      are most acutely at risk during the summer, when they do not have access to
      school meals. In 2015, about 3.8 million children received Summer Meals - far
      fewer than the 21 million children who receive free or reduced price lunches
      through the National School Lunch Program during the school year. This means
      that during the summer we are not reaching the vast majority of children who
      rely on school meals to meet their nutritional needs. The U.S. Department of
      Agriculture (USDA) operates summer meals programs to address this problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We
      are pleased to inform you that our <a href=\"https://news.hcpss.org/news-posts/2019/05/summer-2019-food-service-program-expands-sites-to-help-children-and-families-in-need/\"
      target=\"_blank\">2019 Open Site Summer Meals Program</a> will begin on Tuesday,
      June 25, 2019 and run through Wednesday, August 21, 2019. The program hours
      will vary from location to location. All children 18 years of age and younger
      who drop in at any of the sites may receive free meals. Parents or guardians
      do not need to apply to get these summer meals for their children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If
      you have any questions or want to see a list of sites and their hours, please
      contact HCPSS Food and Nutrition Service at 410-313-7134 or at <a href=\"https://www.hcpss.org/food-services/\"

      Atholton Families,</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>It is with excitement that I, along with
      all of the staff at Atholton Elementary, welcome you to the 2019-2020 school
      year.&nbsp; We are excited that in just eleven days the halls and rooms at AES
      will once again be filled with our students. We have been busy preparing for
      the upcoming school year with our leadership team and various staff work groups.
      Many staff members participated in professional learning, taught summer school,
      attended meetings and planned during the summer months and we are grateful for
      their commitment to our students.&nbsp; Our custodial team (Mr. Lincoln, Mr.
      Osei, Mr. Cureton and Mrs. Smith) did an amazing job preparing the building
      for opening; the floors are glistening!&nbsp; Our incredible office staff was
      busy registering students and keeping things organized!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>In
      addition to the new students and families that will join us this school year,
      we will also welcome several new staff members.&nbsp; We look forward to greeting
      the smiling faces of new and returning students and working and learning with
      our new and returning staff members.&nbsp; Our theme for this school year is
      &ldquo;Constructing Great Minds and Building a Strong Foundation.&rdquo;&nbsp;
      The AES staff will work collaboratively to support and maintain a positive school
      culture and learning environment for all, where everyone is valued, connected,
      supported and appreciated.&nbsp; It is through our collective efforts that we
      will reach all students, academically, socially and emotionally while encouraging
      and modeling how to be kind citizens, problem solvers and creative thinkers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>As
      the summer comes to an end it begins a new and exciting chapter.&nbsp; In addition
      to the excitement, the new year brings new experiences and new opportunities
      to learn and grow.&nbsp; The road ahead is paved and ready to be traveled!&nbsp;
      Undoubtedly, the road will have its share of twists and turns but, it will be
      traveled in great company with our students, staff and community.&nbsp; We are
      excited to see the difference we are going to make this year!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Our
      phones, email inboxes, and doors are always open for feedback, questions, and
      suggestions.&nbsp; We look forward to serving each of you!</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Best,</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Dr.

      child&rsquo;s safety is important and we need your help. It remains our highest
      priority to ensure that students are dropped off and picked up daily in a safe
      and organized manner.&nbsp; We are reminding everyone to follow the pick-up,
      drop-off procedures.&nbsp; Failure to do so creates chaos, and unsafe conditions
      for our students, parents, and staff.&nbsp; Please be kind to our staff and
      community members that may be directing traffic and guiding students.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Schoolwide
      Arrival</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Please have your child come to school the
      way he/she will come to school every day.&nbsp; We will have staff boarding
      buses and placing bus number tags on backpacks.&nbsp; All bus riders will be
      escorted into the building. Our walkers and car riders will enter through the
      rear entrance doors.&nbsp; Doors will open at 9:00 a.m.&nbsp; Any student arriving
      after 9:15 a.m. must be accompanied by an adult to the front office.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Kindergarten
      students that attend the Open House will receive a nametag necklace specific
      to the assigned to teacher.&nbsp; If families are unable to attend the Open
      House, the kindergarten student will receive a nametag the first day of school.&nbsp;
      Staff will guide the kindergarteners off the bus and escort them to class.&nbsp;
      Kindergarten staff will also meet walkers and car riders at the back of the
      school next to the blacktop.&nbsp; Students in grades 1-5 will be directed to
      their classrooms.&nbsp; Staff will be available throughout the building to assist
      all students.&nbsp; We ask parents/guardians to say goodbye at home and at the
      front or rear door of the school.&nbsp; Thank you for understanding.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>During
      arrival, between 8:50 a.m. and 9:15 a.m. orange cones will be placed along the
      crosswalk at the back of the school. During this time cars cannot enter or exit
      the rear parking lot.&nbsp; Persons that enter the parking lot prior to 8:50
      a.m. will be asked to remain in the parking lot until 9:15 a.m.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Please
      do not leave your child without supervision. There is no supervision for students
      until 9:00 a.m.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>AM Drop Off</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Parents/guardians
      driving children to school should use the Atholton Park or park along Donleigh
      Drive.&nbsp; Please do not park along the entrance or exit to Atholton Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Please be courteous of our neighbors and only park on one side of the street
      in the neighborhood.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Parents may also park on Groveleigh Drive
      and use the crosswalk to escort children across the street.&nbsp; Please do
      not drop off children along Seneca Drive.&nbsp; This is dangerous.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>After
      all buses have dropped off students, cars will be permitted to enter the bus
      loop, after 9:15 a.m.&nbsp;&nbsp; If your child arrives after 9:15, please park
      and walk your student to the main office to sign them in.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Dismissal</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>All
      car riders, walkers, and students that participate in after school programs
      or attend after care centers will be dismissed at 3:38 p.m.&nbsp; All bus riders
      will be dismissed at 3:45 p.m.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Please inform your child&rsquo;s
      teacher in writing if dismissal is different than arrival.&nbsp; During dismissal,
      our staff will ensure students get on the correct bus based on the bus they
      rode to school in the morning, or other information obtained in writing from
      the parent/guardian.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Please do not email to teachers to inform
      them of dismissal changes.&nbsp; They will be with students and may not see
      your email.&nbsp; Please call the school and speak to the office staff if your
      child&rsquo;s dismissal procedures change and you did not provide a written
      note.&nbsp; We will make certain the child&rsquo;s teacher is informed.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>All
      walkers will be escorted to the back of the school to meet their parent/guardian,
      or be escorted to the parent/guardian selected after care provider or program.&nbsp;
      All walker/car rider kindergarten students will be dismissed from the rear kindergarten
      doors and be released to the parent/guardian, or designated adult for pick up.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Parents/guardians
      of walkers and car riders should park at Atholton Park and walk to the back
      of the school to meet their children.&nbsp; If the Atholton Park lot is full,
      please do not park along the entrance to the park.&nbsp; Please park along Donleigh.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Bus
      Information</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>If your child rides a bus, please arrive
      at the bus stop 5-10 minutes before your bus is due to arrive in the morning.&nbsp;
      Please allow some flexibility in morning and afternoon arrival times the first
      few weeks of school.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>It is very important to put your
      child on the bus on the first day. Students who ride buses will have their bus
      number tagged on their backpack with a wristband strip. Please leave the bus
      tag on their backpack. This will help staff escort students to the correct bus
      in the afternoon and throughout the school year.</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p><strong>Food
      Services</strong></p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<p>Our Food and Nutrition Services web page

      (3rd-5th Grade), and Chorus (4th-5th Grade) are all being offered virtually
      this year and your young musicians are invited to sign-up today. The Band, Strings,
      and Chorus classes this year will look very different from the Spring. Band
      and Strings classes will be held synchronously through Google Meet twice a week
      and Chorus will be once a month. Students will also be expected to practice
      outside of their synchronous meetings. The best part is that students will not
      miss synchronous instruction from their other classes! This is a fantastic opportunity
      for your young musicians to break up the flow of their school day by moving,
      learning something new, and making music with their friends and music teachers.</span></span></span></p>

      and Board of Education are evaluating possibilities for a hybrid instructional
      model for the second semester, beginning February 1, 2021, which could include
      opportunities for in-person instruction. A hybrid model could provide an option
      for parents/guardians to send their child to school part of the week and learn
      virtually for the remainder of the week.</p>\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<p>This
      fall, there will be significant public discussion and consideration around the
      second semester. At this time, HCPSS is seeking to understand families&rsquo;
      intentions regarding sending their students back to school, if that option becomes
      available, or continuing fully virtual learning. Please see directions below
      for accessing this questionnaire. Please note, this is separate from the small
      group instruction survey that some families have received. Additionally, it
      is crucial for planning to know if students who qualify to receive bus service
      would use it. Parent/guardian response is not a commitment for the second semester;
      you will be able to change your decision when plans for second semester are

      to further reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19. All schools will have
      outdoor eating spaces available on campus for student use as weather and staffing
      permits to lessen the number of students in the&nbsp;cafeteria. In an effort
      to maintain a healthy environment in&nbsp;cafeterias, the following actions
      are being implemented:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul style=\"color: rgb(83, 83, 83); font-family:

      from vendors, large tents that are compliant with local code will be provided

      provided in September.\L</li>\n\t<li>Plexiglass shields for indoor&nbsp;cafeteria&nbsp;tables
      are being secured for grades k-6 where students are largely unable to be vaccinated.
      These panels will provide additional protection between students who are unable
      to be vaccinated while eating when masks cannot be worn.\L</li>\n</ul>\n"

      Maryland Green School at the highest possible level, known as Sustainable. This
      award has been 14 years in the making, so it was quite a treat to be informed
      of the good news on the evening of Earth Day. To become a certified Maryland
      Green School, a rigorous set of standards must be documented, to include environmental
      instruction throughout the school, student-driven best-management practices
      to promote sustainability, environmental staff professional learning, school-wide
      environmental celebrations/events, and partnership with the community to carry
      out our goals. We began this mission in 2007, receiving our first certification
      and Green School flag in 2009. The following three certifications would be awarded,
      through rigorous application, every four years, documenting four years of Green
      School activity per application. Check out our incredible</span><span style=\"color:

      As you peruse our electronic application, you will see years and years of dedication
      to incorporating Green School values at AES, serving as a model for our community.
      Did you know we have a beautiful native garden? Have you been to our outdoor
      classroom? Did you know we raise and release Trout and Monarch butterflies every
      year? Have you seen the amazing recycled sculptures our students create each
      year for America Recycles Day? Has your family participated in Bike to School
      Day? Has your child been involved in a scout troop that volunteers to support
      our Green School? Did you know we have student recyclers at AES? We have countless
      examples of the work we continue to do to support our amazing Green School.
      Thank you for your support over the years. Our work is not yet done. We will
      forge on to ensure Atholton continues to operate with the environment in mind.
      And though our next application, four years from now, will look a little different
      from what we have submitted previously, we will still be held accountable by
      the Maryland Association of Environmental Outdoor Education for the Green School
      efforts we make.</span><span style=\"color: inherit; font: inherit; margin:

      glue stick collection.&nbsp; During the past few school years, we have collected
      between 1,500 and 2,000 empty glue sticks per year, sending them off for upcycling
      and keeping them out of our landfills.&nbsp; They are then turned into something
      else, like a park bench or a school carpet.&nbsp; What&#39;s more, our school
      receives 2 cents for every glue stick we send to Terracycle.&nbsp; (That&#39;s
      where the &quot;jingle&quot; comes in.)&nbsp; This year, we will collect glue
      sticks in Pringles chip cans.&nbsp; Each classroom will have a can, which will
      be covered to look like a giant glue stick!&nbsp; We need your help.&nbsp; If

      our students will jump into the fight against heart disease and stroke with
      Jump Rope For Heart. The event will be <strong>during</strong> school when students
      would normally have related arts classes. Students will actively participate
      in a variety of jumping and cardiovascular fitness activities on one day of
      the event. Students will be learning about heart health on the day that their
      class is not in the gymnasium. The event will support the American Heart Association,
      whose research and education efforts help save lives in the community and across
      the nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two papers being sent home in this week&rsquo;s
      Friday folders with instructions for the fundraiser. Fundraising is optional,
      and all students in the school will participate in the event. If you choose
      to participate in the fundraising portion of our school&rsquo;s event, all donations
      are due to Mrs. Hlavka by <strong>Wednesday February 11<sup>th</sup>, 2015.</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>

      year, Mrs. Hlavka, Mrs. Crochunis and Mr. Tobin have volunteered to allow the
      top fundraiser in our school a chance to pie a teacher in the face. Each student
      who fundraises will get to vote for the teacher that they would like to see
      receive the pie. Each student&rsquo;s fundraising amount determines how much
      his or her vote counts. Upon completion of our fundraiser, students will gather
      for our ending ceremony and watch our school&rsquo;s top fundraiser serve the
      pie to the teacher!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Please e-mail Mrs. Hlavka at <a href=\"mailto:Lindsay_Hlavka@hcpss.org\">Lindsay_Hlavka@hcpss.org</a>

      We are using this theme to encourage our families and staff to engage in some
      Earth Day Week activities:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Starting this weekend and
      running all week, through next weekend, AES families are encouraged to take
      &#39;selfies&#39; of any Earth-friendly transportation they engage in to get
      somewhere, which could include walking, bike-riding, carpooling, or taking a
      bus.&nbsp; Selfies should include everyone involved and should be sent to Mrs.
      Simon in the front office (michelle_simon@hcpss.org).&nbsp; She will print them
      out and put them on a bulletin board in our front hallway.&nbsp; Our goal is
      to fill up the board with pictures of our students and staff using Earth-Friendly
      ways to get around in our community.&nbsp; When you email your selfie to Mrs.
      Simon, be sure to explain the photo.</li>\r\n\t<li>An &quot;Earth-Friendly Transportation&quot;
      survey can be found in today&#39;s Friday folders.&nbsp; Please consider reading
      the directions to fill out one or more portion(s) of the survey.&nbsp; Each
      portion returned to school will serve as a submission for daily drawings during
      morning announcements.&nbsp; Surveys will get shared on announcements and posted
      on our hallway tree.&nbsp; We look forward to hearing how the families of our
      school consider the Earth while getting from one place to another.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All
      students were presented this information by fifth grade Green Ambassadors during
      Thursday&#39;s lunch shifts.&nbsp; Students were told parents would also receive
      this information in the Panther Press.&nbsp; Thank you for participating in
      Atholton&#39;s Earth Day fun.&nbsp; As always, we will continue our Waste-free
      lunches, recycling, and our regular environmental instruction &nbsp; Have a
      wonderful Earth Day Week; hope you can get outside to enjoy NATURE!</p>\r\n"

    body: "<p>We recently learned that manufacturing problems will cause a nationwide
      delay in the production of FluMist,&nbsp;the intranasal flu vaccine.&nbsp; Because
      FluMist is used for our school clinic,&nbsp;<strong>our flu clinic must be rescheduled</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Medimmune,
      the company that makes FluMist, expects to correct this&nbsp;problem by the
      end of November.&nbsp; For this reason, we are <strong>rescheduling our school&#39;s
      flu clinic for December</strong>.&nbsp; Depending on when the vaccine is ready,
      it is possible that our&nbsp;clinic may be held as early as November or as late
      as January.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Important things to know about&nbsp;influenza (&quot;the
      flu&quot;) and the FluMist manufacturing situation:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The
      flu is a serious illness.&nbsp;The best way to prevent the flu is through immunization.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Most
      cases of the flu usually happen in&nbsp;February so&nbsp;<strong>December and
      January are&nbsp;not too late to be vaccinated</strong>; <em>however</em>,</li>\r\n\t<li>You
      may be able to get Injectable or&nbsp;intranasal&nbsp;vaccine now&nbsp;at your
      child&#39;s doctor&#39;s office or community immunizers like pharmacies.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>If
      your child gets&nbsp;a flu vaccination or any other type of immunization between
      now and the&nbsp;school flu&nbsp;clinic, and you have previously consented to
      have your child vaccinated at school, please alert your school nurse at 410-313-7429.</li>\r\n\t<li>We
      continue to plan for our flu clinic so, if you have not already, please return
      your child&#39;s flu consent form by October 30.&nbsp; Having these forms will
      make sure we&#39;re ready for the December clinics.&nbsp; We also will be prepared
      if FluMist becomes available sooner.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We appreciate your
      patience and cooperation and will be in&nbsp;touch about the new flu clinic
      date.&nbsp; In the meantime, if you have not already, <strong>please return
      your&nbsp;child&#39;s FluMist consent form by&nbsp;October 30</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

      The PTA is providing the food for the party except for a couple of items the

      will be able to come into the building after the parade.&nbsp; As children begin
      the process of choosing a costume, please remind them that they will not be
      able to bring any toy weapons to school and gory/bloody make-up should be saved
      for parties/trick-or-treating outside of school.&nbsp; Students will bring their
      costumes to school in a bag. We will have an alternative activity planned for
